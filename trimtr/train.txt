"I didn't do it. They create a phony crime," Trump said during a live interview on "Hannity." "And then, they say, 'he obstructed.' They said there was no collusion but 'he obstructed,' and there has never been anything like this ever in this country."

When asked by lawmakers whether or not the findings of the nearly two-year-long Russia investigation truly exonerated the president, Mueller testified before two House committees on Wednesday afternoon, answering, "No."resident Trump lashed out at Democrats following former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's testimony on Capitol Hill, telling Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday night the Democrats "created this phony crime" by accusing him of obstruction of justice.

"I didn't do it. They create a phony crime," Trump said during a live interview on "Hannity." "And then, they say, 'he obstructed.' They said there was no collusion but 'he obstructed,' and there has never been anything like this ever in this country."

When asked by lawmakers whether or not the findings of the nearly two-year-long Russia investigation truly exonerated the president, Mueller testified before two House committees on Wednesday afternoon, answering, "No."

Trump reiterated his desire to "investigate the investigators" over the origins of the Russia probe and said Attorney General William Barr would be "looking into it."

For his part, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said after the hearings: "Today was a watershed day in telling the facts to the American people. With those facts, we can proceed, and we face a time of great danger."

"This should never happen to another president of the United States again," Trump said. "This is an absolute catastrophe for our country. This was a fake witch hunt."

During his testimony, Mueller denied Trump's assertions that the investigation was a "witch hunt" and insinuated that the Trump campaign welcomed Russian aid to help them win the 2016 election.

(CNN) - The manhunt for two Canadian teenagers suspected of killing three people is focused on a swampy, small town in rural northern Manitoba with just over 1,000 people and an inhospitable environment.

Canadian authorities converged Thursday on Gillam in their search for Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, who are accused of killing a roadtripping couple and a university botany teacher. The search for the teens has taken authorities about 2,000 miles across Canada's rural north -- from British Columbia to Manitoba -- in a case with victims with three different nationalities.

The suspects were reportedly spotted in Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, on Sunday, and their Toyota RAV4 was found on fire and discarded in an area outside of Gillam near the Fox Lake Cree Nation reserve on Monday.

The two also were spotted twice in the area of Gillam, a town with one road in and out, before the burnt vehicle was discovered, Cpl. Julie Courchaine, a spokeswoman for the Manitoba division of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, said.

She said there are no reports of car thefts in the town that can be linked to the duo.

"We believe they are still in the area," she told reporters. About 80 tips have come in in the past two days, she said.

The manhunt includes the use of aircraft and police dogs, she said.

Tough conditions in search area

The two are suspected of killing Chynna Deese, a 24-year-old American, and Lucas Fowler, her 23-year-old Australian boyfriend, whose bodies were found July 15 near Liard Hot Springs in northern British Columbia.

The duo is also charged with second-degree murder in the death of Len Dyck, a lecturer at the University of British Columbia, whose body was found July 19 near Dease Lake in British Columbia.

Authorities initially believed McLeod and Schmegelsky were missing, but they were named as suspects on Tuesday. They are considered armed and dangerous, authorities said.

If the teens are on foot, they will be dealing with difficult weather and hordes of biting flies, Gillam officials said.

"We have sandflies, black flies, mosquitoes, horseflies," Gillam Deputy Mayor John McDonald said. "Let me say if we were parked on a side street and we were having a conversation outside, and you didn't have any insect repellent on, or any long sleeves -- let's just say that we would cut our conversation short."

"And in the bush," McDonald said. "Magnify that by 10-20 times. Forget it."

Courchaine said the search was tough.

"This is very challenging terrain. ... There's lots of dense bush, forest, swampy area," she said.

A tight-knit community locks its doors

The strong police presence associated with a manhunt is particularly noticeable in Gillam, a tight-knit community of 1,200 people not known as much of a destination.

"Most of us in Gillam are baffled as to why they would be here. There's only one road in and one road out," McDonald said.

A tactical assault vehicle sits outside the locked town offices, where the RCMP has set up their command center for the search.

"Everyone is keeping their door locked during the day," McDonald said. "Just being a little more cautious than normal."

The search has been focused on the rugged bush near Fox Lake Cree Nation. The weather conditions and biting flies in Gillam this time of year are intense, and are making it difficult for police -- and, potentially, the suspects -- to stay out for long.

"You have to hand it to the RCMP out there in all their gear in the bush," McDonald said, noting that it was 31 degrees Celsius, or 88 degrees Fahrenheit, on Wednesday.

Suspect will go out in 'blaze of glory,' father says

Schmegelsky's father said Wednesday that he doesn't believe his son will survive the manhunt.

"Basically, he's going to be dead today or tomorrow. I know that," Alan Schmegelsky told The Canadian Press, according to CNN news partner CTV News. "Rest in peace, Bryer. I love you. I'm so sorry all this had to happen. I'm so sorry that I couldn't rescue you."

The father said his son has been dealing with mental anguish and plans to go out in "a blaze of glory."

"A normal child doesn't travel across the country, killing people. A child in some very serious pain does," he said.

Alan Schmegelsky described his son as an introvert, saying he played a lot of video games. He said McLeod and his son were good friends and hung out together. Both had jobs at Walmart, but they said they weren't making enough money and decided to go to Alberta to look for work, he said.

"I believed that's what they were going to do, and I was absolutely flabbergasted to learn that two days later, and I found this out from the paper," he said.

McLeod is 6 feet, 4 inches tall, 169 pounds and has dark hair, facial hair and brown eyes. Schmegelsky is 6 feet, 4 inches tall and 169 pounds with sandy hair, police said.

A couple in love and a university lecturer

Deese and Fowler were on a road trip through Canada to Alaska, their families said. Fowler was living in British Columbia, and they were exploring the area while Deese was visiting, RCMP said.

Canadian police released surveillance video Monday of Fowler and Deese embracing at a gas station in Fort Nelson on July 13. Her mother, Sheila Deese, told CNN she watched that video over and over again.

The mother said she was struck by the size 12 boots that Fowler was wearing. When she visited Chynna's apartment in Charlotte before the trip, Chynna was struggling to fit those same boots into her suitcase.

"I got Lucas these boots. I hope he likes them," Chynna said at the time, her mother recalled.

Fowler's father, New South Wales Police Force Chief Inspector Stephen Fowler, said his son was "having the time of his life" traveling the world with a woman he loved.

"I may be an experienced police officer, but today I'm standing here as the father of a murder victim," he said Monday. "We are just distraught. This has really torn two families apart."

Police found Dyck's body Friday about a mile from where a vehicle and camper belonging to McLeod and Schmegelsky were found burning on the side of Highway 37.

Dyck was a sessional lecturer in the University of British Columbia's Department of Botany and a research associate at the university's DeWreede Lab, and his research focused on seaweeds.

"The UBC community is shocked and saddened by this news and we offer our deepest condolences to Mr. Dyck's family, friends and his colleagues at the university," the university said.

The RCMP did not say how Dyck was identified, but his family has been notified.

"We are truly heart broken by the sudden and tragic loss of Len," a statement from his family said. "His death has created unthinkable grief and we are struggling to understand what has happened. While we understand there will be interest in knowing more about him and the impact he had during his life, we are asking for the public and the media to please respect our privacy during this difficult time."

(CNN) - The father of one of two Canadian teens wanted in the killings of a young American woman, her Australian boyfriend and a Canadian man said Wednesday that he doesn't believe his son will survive the nationwide manhunt.

"Basically, he's going to be dead today or tomorrow. I know that," Alan Schmegelsky, whose son Bryer is a suspect, told The Canadian Press. "Rest in peace, Bryer. I love you. I'm so sorry all this had to happen. I'm so sorry that I couldn't rescue you."

The comments came the same day authorities charged Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, with one count of second degree murder in the death of Leonard "Len" Dyck of Vancouver, British Columbia.

Dyck's body was found Friday, and authorities were able to identify him after releasing a composite sketch of the man.

"As a result of the charges, Canada-wide warrants have been issued," the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Department said in a news release. "RCMP investigators across the country continue to share information with other law enforcement agencies as the suspects remain at large."

The suspects have been moving east since last week, authorities said. They were reportedly spotted in Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, on Sunday, and their Toyota vehicle was found burned on Monday near Gillam, a town of just over 1,200 people with only one major road running through it.

Initially, the two were believed to be missing. Now, the RCMP say they are suspects in the shooting deaths of Dyck, as well as Chynna Noelle Deese, a 24-year-old American, and Lucas Robertson Fowler, her 23-year-old Australian boyfriend.

Go out in a 'blaze of glory'

In the emotionally charged interview with The Canadian Press, Alan Schmegelsky said his son has been dealing with mental anguish and plans to go out in "a blaze of glory."

"A normal child doesn't travel across the country, killing people. A child in some very serious pain does," he said.

Schmegelsky described his son as an introvert, saying he played a lot of video games.

He said McLeod and his son were good friends, who hung out a lot together.

Both had jobs at Walmart, but said they weren't making enough money and decided to go to Alberta to look for work, he said.

"I believed that's what they were going to do, and I was absolutely flabbergasted to learn that two days later, and I found this out from the paper," he said.

Schmegelsky said he believes the RCMP will "shoot first and ask questions later."

Police say the two are 'armed and dangerous'

McLeod and Schmegelsky are considered armed and dangerous, and members of the public should not approach them, authorities said. They were last seen in northern Saskatchewan — about a day's drive east of where the bodies were found — driving a gray 2011 Toyota RAV4, authorities said.

The pair may now be in Manitoba, east of Saskatchewan, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. The Manitoba RCMP confirmed Wednesday they had recovered the suspects' Toyota near Gillam.

"The two may being using a different vehicle, on foot or even traveling separately. If they are spotted, do not approach, call 9-1-1 or your local police immediately," the RCMP said.

The RCMP have dispatched more officers to the area and set up an informational checkpoint at the road leading into town, RCMP Cpl. Julie Courchaine said.

McLeod is 6 feet, 4 inches tall, 169 pounds and has dark hair, facial hair and brown eyes. Schmegelsky is 6 feet, 4 inches tall and 169 pounds with sandy hair, police said.

They are suspected in the shooting deaths of Deese and Fowler, whose bodies were found on July 15 about 12 miles south of Liard Hot Springs in northern British Columbia, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said.

Fowler was living in British Columbia, and they were exploring the area while Deese was visiting him, RCMP Sgt. Janelle Shoihet said. Deese's mother, Sheila Deese, said the couple had been on a road trip through Canada up to Alaska.

'His death has created unthinkable grief'

Police found Dyck's body several days later about a mile from where a vehicle and camper belonging to McLeod and Schmegelsky were found burning on the side of Highway 37.

Dyck was a sessional, or contract, lecturer in the University of British Columbia's Department of Botany and a research associate at the university's DeWreede Lab. His research focused on seaweeds.

"The UBC community is shocked and saddened by this news and we offer our deepest condolences to Mr. Dyck's family, friends and his colleagues at the university," the university said.

The RCMP did not say how Dyck was identified, but his family has been notified.

"We are truly heart broken by the sudden and tragic loss of Len," a statement from his family said. "His death has created unthinkable grief and we are struggling to understand what has happened. While we understand there will be interest in knowing more about him and the impact he had during his life, we are asking for the public and the media to please respect our privacy during this difficult time."

Authorities declined to say what new information led them to name the two Canadian teenagers as suspects. But it came just a day after the RCMP said it was a "possible" that their disappearance was related to the couple's death.

The teens, both from Port Alberni, were traveling through British Columbia to the Yukon Territory to look for work, the RCMP had said.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story credited the wrong media organization that interviewed Alan Schmegelsky. It was The Canadian Press.

(CNN) - Scherie Murray is the most recent black Republican getting heavy rotation on conservative media outlets. Not because of policies or any political experience. She is a black Donald Trump supporter, which is the latest stunt to become famous in politics or social media.

Last week, Murray announced she would challenge Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York's 14th district, calling the freshmen congressional representative's politics "toxic" and claiming that she is just "worried about being famous."

However, just a year ago, Murray was praising AOC, writing on Twitter, "Congratulations Alexandria. #Queens is headed in a new direction and It's time for new leadership. #Yes."

AOC has only been in office six months and was clear about her vision before her opponent congratulated her. Murray has a history of being a Democrat who reportedly switched to being a Republican a decade ago; however, she admittedly voted for Barack Obama twice. Challenging AOC as a Democrat would not have gotten her the press she appears to crave.

Since her grand announcement, the 38-year-old businesswoman has appeared on Fox News' "Watters' World," "The Ingraham Angle" and "Sean Hannity."

Shouldn't that time be spent talking to her constituents, who are predominantly Democrat and obviously not Fox News watchers? Most bizarre, the Jamaican-born immigrant does not even live in the district she wants to represent; she resides in Laurelton, Queens. However, her Twitter followers have skyrocketed and, I predict, so have her donations.

So what changed? The same thing that may have changed Candace Owens, Omarosa Manigault Newman, or countless others. The access to political fame is much quicker when you are in a black body condoning, advocating, and providing talking points to support blatant racism, and appalling policies that target black and brown communities.

Omarosa Manigault Newman is certainly a trailblazer in the field of opportunist Trump worshippers. After she disappeared from media, she saw an opportunity and campaigned for Trump. She claimed she knew he used the N-word before the 2016 election but that didn't stop her. Trump has denied that he used the N-word.

The reality star, who once worked in -- and was fired from -- Bill Clinton's administration, gleefully wore the "Make America Great Again" hat and told the country to "bow down" to Trump. Only after she was fired from Trump's White House did she claim to see the racist light and went on a failed apology tour. By the way, what happened to the damning Trump recording she promised would drop before the 2018 midterms? Anything to sell a product, just as Trump taught her, and her book was a New York Times bestseller.

Then there is Candace Owens, Omarosa 2.0. The 30-year-old was the CEO of a website, called Degree180, which frequently had anti-Trump posts. When the site shut down in 2016, no one knew her name until she "came out" as a conservative on YouTube a few months later. Her videos quickly went viral and soon she was tap-dancing on Fox News.

Owens now calls the NAACP "one of the worst groups for Black people," when the organization helped her win a $37,500 settlement over racial discrimination. Connecticut NAACP president Scot X. Esdaile, who helped with the case, told Mic in April of 2018, "We're very saddened and disappointed in her. It seems to me that she's now trying to play to a different type of demographic."

Owens, who once said on Fox News that the NRA was founded as a civil rights organization that protected Black people from the KKK, got the airtime she wouldn't have gotten as a liberal commentator or via her failed doxxing site. She now speaks all over the country and has over 1.5 million followers on Twitter. She also made hateful comments while she was communications director of Turning Point USA, a conservative student activism group. Her most vile moment was when she babbled that she would be okay if Hitler just wanted to "make Germany great ." After comments like these (though she did later try to clarify them), she was still invited by Republicans to speak before the House Judiciary Committee hearing on "Hate Crimes and the Rise of White Nationalism." Without her convenient conversion, she would still be a struggling personality.

Even MTV's latest season of "The Real World" is marketing a Black, pansexual Trump supporter, and Refinery 29 predicts "culture clashes." Considering the Trump administration's rollback on LGBT protections, we'll see how sincere the 25-year-old's support of Trump is.

Contrary to what Kanye West, who says he's never voted, might want you to believe, black Trump worshippers are not free thinkers. Throughout history, there have always been black folks who betrayed their own but the path to freedom has never been forged by aligning with the oppressor.

Do Republicans know this new flock of Trump worshippers may be frauds? Absolutely. How could they not when the receipts are easily traceable? Nonetheless, a fraud is worth it if they can find a black apologist who will allow Republicans to use the trite excuse of, "See, Trump can't be racist -- look at Ben Carson!"

Black Republicans are in the very fabric of American history. The first African Americans to hold political office were part of the Radical Republican Party in the late 1800s. But this isn't about policy; it's about fame and followers, another result of our cult of celebrity.

Owens, Murray, neck-rolling Diamond and Silk, Pastor Darrell Scott and a handful of other Trump supporters' main talking points have been "get off the Democratic planation" and "welfare policies are destroying black people" -- when there are more white people who are helped by federal assistance programs than black people. Their talking points are trite, combative and often times factually incorrect.

These are not the Republicans of Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice or Sen. Tim Scott, with whom I vehemently disagree but whose careers speak to their commitment and intentions -- which may be why you never see them associate with the current crop of black Trump followers. Moreover, being a black Republican doesn't mean you have to be a black Trump supporter.

There is a robust market for the delusional black Trump supporter. It is, as we've seen, a shorter line to fame, money, celebrity and power. Scherie Murray is the latest to have sold her soul and she will be welcomed with open arms, regardless of her chances of winning or the fact that she was openly supportive of Obama and Ocasio-Cortez. Ironically, it is comparable to the affirmative action that Trump's administration has been against.

Trump denies that he is a racist, but the rhetoric and policies -- which are supported by white nationalists -- are clear. For the black Trump supporters, they are not in the dark. They know exactly who the President is. Yes, black people are not a monolith -- but we must all be a monolith against white supremacy and the politicians who fail to speak out against it.

(CNN) - President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Monica Crowley, who was appointed by Trump last week as assistant treasury secretary for public affairs, made multiple comments spreading these false claims on her personal blog and in at least one tweet between 2009 and 2015, according to a review by CNN's KFile team.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an "Islamic community organizer" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were "legitimate concerns." During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010, Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

"Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate," wrote Crowley. "He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57."

"It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?" she added.

Crowley added, "How could he....support the enemy?"

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

"If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe," wrote Crowley.

"For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background," she added. "He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst."

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing about the Obama administration in June 2013, Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

"The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out," she wrote. "What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy."

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

"Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba," she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. "The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

"Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya," she added. "Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'."

In February 2015, Crowley shared what she called an "important column," with the title "Obama's Two Faces of Islam." The column, written by author Bill Siegel and still available on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, argues that Obama is an "Islamic community organizer" and is "conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia."

"The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia," reads the column.

"Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy "companions" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."

Edinburg, Texas (CNN) - The Texas-born high school student who was detained by immigration officials for more than three weeks told CNN Thursday he was treated less than human at a US Customs and Border Protection facility.

Francisco Galicia, 18, says he was held in filthy, overcrowded conditions where he was not allowed to shower for 23 days, forced to sleep on a cement floor and not given enough food. By the time he was released Tuesday, after word spread about his detention following a report by The Dallas Morning News, he said he was malnourished, having dropped 26 pounds.

"They were not treating us humanely," Galicia told CNN during a wide-ranging interview. "...The stress was so high, they (detention center agents) were on me all the time. It was like psychological torture to the point where I almost (agreed to be deported). I felt safer to be in the cell than to be with the officers. "

'They threatened me with charges'

The problem began, he says, on June 27 while he was on his way to a college soccer scouting event.

He was traveling with his 17-year-old brother Marlon, as well as a group of friends, from his hometown of Edinburg to Houston when they were stopped at a CBP checkpoint in Falfurrias, about 100 miles north of the US-Mexico border.

Francisco Galicia was born in Texas, and he is an American citizen. As a child, he moved to Mexico with his family and later returned to the US as a teenager. He says he was carrying his state ID, a Social Security card and a wallet-sized birth certificate.

He also had a Mexican tourist visa with him that inaccurately listed his country of birth as Mexico, setting up a conflicting nationality claim, his attorney, Claudia Galan, said.

Both brothers were detained, and Marlon Galicia, who does not have legal status in the US, was retuned to Mexico. Francisco Galicia was sent to an immigration detention center.

"They didn't believe me. I kept telling them over and over, and they kept saying my documents were fake, and they were going to deport me," Galicia said. "...They threatened me with charges -- charges about falsifying documents. Felonies. They kept asking how it was possible for me to not know where I was from. I almost signed (to be deported) because I didn't want to suffer there anymore. "

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials declined a CNN request for comment on Galicia's allegations and pointed back to a joint ICE-CBP statement on Wednesday following the teen's release.

"This individual provided conflicting reports regarding status of citizenship after being apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol and transferred into Immigration and Customs Enforcement Custody," the statement said.

The statement continued, "Situations including conflicting reports from the individual and multiple birth certificates can, and should, take more time to verify. While we continue to research the facts of the situation, the individual has been released from ICE custody."

'You have no rights'

Galicia said he was not allowed to call his family or an attorney while he was detained.

"The moment I got there, we told them we have the right to a phone call and to a lawyer, and they told us, 'you have no rights,'" he said.

Galicia described squalid conditions in the facility where he was held, saying he was held in a small room with about 70 other people. There was one toilet, with no doors or wall.

Every few days, he said, he and those held with him were given wipes.

"It was to clean up but the dirt, but you couldn't get rid of it because so much time had passed since we showered," he said.

Galicia dismissed President Donald Trump's assertion that many of the people crossing the border are "bad actors," who mean to do harm to the US and its people. He said the people he met who were being held with him at the facility meant no harm.

"They just wanted to come for a better future. They were fleeing their countries because they were being threatened or kidnapped," he said.

Attorney says she was given the runaround

While Galicia was being held, an attorney retained by his family said she tried for a least a week to get in touch with the teen while he was being held but was given the runaround by CBP and ICE.

Galan says she tried in vain for at least a week to get in touch with Galicia while he was being held, but was given the runaround by Border Patrol.

"They told him he had no right to an attorney," Galan said. "Once I went to border patrol headquarters, they told me the same thing. ... They said that I couldn't get any information until he consented, but he didn't even know I was trying to get him out."

Galan has said she shared documents two weeks ago with CBP proving Galicia was a US citizen -- including a birth certificate showing he was born in Dallas.

Despite the documentation, the attorney said, Galicia was transferred on Saturday to ICE custody for removal proceedings. He was held in the South Texas Detention Complex in Pearsall until his release Tuesday.

By the time he was released, he had been detained for 27 days: one day at the border patrol checkpoint, 23 days at the Falfurrias processing center and three days in Pearsall.

'I am the eyes and the ears of what's happening'

Galicia showed CNN pieces of paper that he said contained phone numbers of the families of those held with him.

"They asked me to reach out to them to let them know that they're OK. They didn't want me to tell them about the conditions in the detention centers -- they only wanted me to tell them that they were OK," he said.

"...Right now, I'm in a place where I can help those who are still in there -- so people can see how they're treated, and change the way they're treated. I am the eyes and ears of what's happening in there. I can talk. They can't do what I'm doing. "

Galicia says he doesn't know if he will take legal action against the CBP, but he does want a measure of justice.

He said he remains a positive person despite being treated so badly.

"It's made me stronger," he said. "I see life differently after seeing how other people have been suffering. It's made me understand many things like how you can live your life while others are suffering."

Washington (CNN) - Hundreds of red flags were raised internally within the Trump administration about how families were being separated at the US-Mexico border, including some from months before the controversial "zero tolerance" policy was announced, according to documents reviewed by CNN.

The documents include anecdotes of children allegedly blindsided when they were separated from their parents after being apprehended at the southern border. One referral received by the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties describes a 14-year-old who said he was separated from his father in May 2018 "after a meal break while in custody, and was told by officers that his father would be deported."

In another, an 11-year-old stated that he "was called aside by an officer and then he did not see his father again." A 10-year-old with "poor communication skills" was allegedly separated from his mother in June 2018.

Taken together, the documents provide a rare glimpse into how one part of the Trump administration -- the Department of Health and Human Services -- was flagging cases of concern to another part -- the Department of Homeland Security -- during a tumultuous time that eventually resulted in the separation of thousands of families apprehended at the southern border.

HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is charged with the care of unaccompanied migrant children, instructed staff to submit significant incident reports for alleged cases of family separation once the agency started seeing an uptick in cases, according to the agency.

The refugee agency was unaware of the "zero tolerance" separation policy prior to its public announcement in April 2018, and the reports were submitted as incidents of abuse in Homeland Security custody and sent to DHS' Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, an agency official said. The zero tolerance policy was officially implemented in May and ended in June after a public outcry.

A separation would typically occur under the pretense that there was a significant incident with a family member, such as abuse or neglect, that would prompt an incident report.

The procedure continued during zero tolerance. The civil rights office receives regular referrals from the refugee office on any complaint that might result from any process within Homeland Security, the refugee official said.

The DHS' civil rights office, which received the referrals, "reviews and investigates civil rights and civil liberties complaints filed by the public" regarding the department's policies and activities.

850 referrals

Of the 850 referrals to the civil rights office of family separation between January 2018 and June 2018, the overwhelming majority are from HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement. Others are from immigrant advocacy groups.

Twelve children who were 1-year-old or younger were allegedly separated between December 2017 and May 2018, according to the documents.

More than 100 referrals sent to DHS' civil rights office predate the announcement of the controversial policy, according to the documents. Some cite criminal history or prior immigration violations of the parents or guardians.

There is a long-standing policy that allows immigration officials to separate a child from a parent if there are concerns for the child's welfare.

Other referrals included in the documents are hazier. In February 2018, for example, the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties received email correspondence from an individual on behalf of a 13-year-old who was also allegedly separated from his mother in December 2017, though the basis of the separation was unclear.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler cited the documents detailing alleged family separations that were obtained by the committee during a panel hearing.

"These documents are startling," he said.

"Even more surprising, the 12 children under the age of 1, nine of those separations occurred before the Trump administration enacted the zero tolerance policy. In many cases, family separation happened without warning and without giving the children the chance to say goodbye to their families. Many were not told where their families were being taken," the New York Democrat added.

The referrals do not explain how a case was resolved.

Watchdog reports

Administration watchdog reports have identified numerous problems in how agencies were monitoring and handling family separations.

In the summer of 2017, Office of Refugee Resettlement staff noticed a spike in the proportion of separated children relative to other unaccompanied children, according to a Health and Human Services inspector general report released in January.

Staff at the refugee agency developed mechanisms to track separations due to operational concerns, according to the report. Younger children, for example, require placement in specially licensed facilities.

Homeland Security had previously said that separations continue to take place in cases when the parents have a criminal history or medical concerns. The department, however, was inconsistent in explaining how many children were separated or what happened to them, according to the report.

"In some cases DHS has provided HHS with limited information about the reasons for these separations," said Ann Maxwell, Assistant Inspector General for Evaluation and Inspections, in January.

"More children over a longer period of time were separated by immigration authorities and were referred to HHS for care than is commonly discussed in the public debate," Maxwell said. "How many more children were separated is unknown."

Last October, a Homeland Security inspector general report also found that the department was "not fully prepared" for the rollout of the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy at the US-Mexico border and that it provided "inconsistent information," which led some parents to not understand that they would be separated from their children and unable to communicate with them.

Court orders in an ongoing lawsuit over family separations have forced officials to identify and reunify a majority of those separated.

During a House Oversight Committee hearing last week, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said he would "go back and redo" the zero-tolerance policy if he could, saying the policy played a role in the department losing the public's trust.

McAleenan also said fewer than 1,000 children have been separated from their parents at the southern border this fiscal year. The department has also warned of individuals posing as families to gain entry into the US.

This story has been updated.

(CNN) - A family is skittish about speaking Spanish at the supermarket. A mother is afraid to let her daughter play outside. A father worries his toddler is now a target.

CNN recently asked immigrants how they feel about President Trump's racist remarks, the fight to add a citizenship question to the US Census and the threat of ICE raids. Many of their responses share a common thread.

Immigrant parents, many of whom are living legally in the United States, opened up about their fears. They say they're growing increasingly worried about their US citizen children's futures and aren't sure how to protect them.

Some say Trump's highly publicized immigration crackdowns and his comments demonizing immigrants and their families have heightened anxieties that were already haunting them. Others say they're now grappling with a new reality they don't know how to face.

Here are some of their stories.

He's worried a school shooter could target his youngest daughter. She's 2

Jorge Chepote knows he's going to have to prepare his 2-year-old daughter for a world that's harsher than she realizes. He's not sure he knows how.

Right now, she goes to a St. Louis daycare where many international families send their children. But she'll have to switch schools in a few years, and the 49-year-old business executive is worried that once she's in a less diverse environment she'll be bullied for coming from an immigrant family.

Or even worse, that a school shooter could put her in his crosshairs.

"We have Muslims targeted, we have African Americans targeted, we have seen Jews targeted. Now I see that any type of immigrant is going to become more of a target. I don't think Trump necessarily is supporting that stuff, but it's the environment he's creating, and to an extent, the unintended consequences of the environment he has created," Chepote says. "I have talked with my wife. What should we do about that? Should we revisit public schools? Consider home schooling or something? That is something that we do worry about."

Chepote says his job brought him to the United States from Peru 13 years ago. He's proud to be a US citizen. But he says since the 2016 election, the country he loves has changed and he feels he must speak out to help his children before it's too late. Many immigrants like him, he says, hear ominous echoes in President Trump's words.

"In the country where I come from there's also been racism like this in the past. It's like a virus. It's like wildfire," he says. "Once it starts, it's very difficult to stop it. ... We still have a chance."

She fears someone will call the police on her family while they're shopping

An 11-year-old walked into her mother's bedroom last week with a question.

"Did you see people that look like me are being separated and put in jail?" she asked.

So the 39-year-old mother -- who was born in the Dominican Republic, immigrated to the United States 30 years ago and became a naturalized US citizen when she was serving in the US military -- had a heartbreaking conversation with her daughter. She described it to CNN but asked to remain anonymous because she's a government contractor and fears she could lose her job for speaking out.

The mother, who lives in New Jersey, says she went through details with her daughter about the situation at the border, Trump's racist tweets, ICE raids and the citizenship question on the census.

"She was very upset. My kids speak Spanish. They travel to the Dominican Republic. They know this is not right. I make sure they go to the library, read a lot of history books. They studied the Holocaust," she tells CNN.

It wasn't the first time this mother faced such issues with her children.

A year ago, she confronted a parent whose son had told another daughter she was going to get deported.

"I told him, 'Your son is bullying my daughter ... My daughter isn't going anywhere, she's as American as your son.'"

Since Trump was elected, the mother says she doesn't feel safe for her kids anymore.

"We have a 14-year-old son that is brown-skinned, although my husband is Italian American. My husband and I do not feel safe letting our son ride a bike alone in our neighborhood, in case someone wants to call the cops on him. So we are hyper vigilant," she says. "When my kids are riding their bicycles where I can't see them, in case the cops stop them, I tell 'say your name and address, and say you want your parents because you're minors. Don't answer any question.' I make them repeat that every day, every time they go out."

Before Trump took office, she says she didn't see this much hostility.

Back then, she says, she could be at the supermarket and not fear about someone calling the cops on her family.

Now, when she goes to a store or a restaurant with her family, she brings three or four types of identification, she says. "ICE tried to deport a veteran that is Hispanic and who has an American passport," she says. "The same could happen to me."

A classmate once told her kids to 'go back' to where they came from

Tania Bravo Groe couldn't believe her ears when her kids told her what someone said to them at school: "Go back to where you crossed the river."

That was in 2015, and the Peruvian-born woman, a naturalized American citizen, had recently moved with her husband, a retired US army officer, to his hometown of Lake Mills, Iowa.

"Obviously I got angry, because my husband is a retired US Army officer and for that reason we'd moved a few times during his active-duty military career and NEVER in all the places we lived (did my kids get) attacked in that way. Never," Bravo Groe tells CNN. "Since that happened, I always ask them, 'Let me know if it happens again, I'll talk to the school, the principal.'"

At the time, she didn't take any action, or try to talk to the kid's parents. But the episode left a scar that's difficult to heal. Despite having been in the States for almost 21 years, Bravo Groe says she's never felt as insecure as now, both for herself and for her children: Alessandra Groe, 18, a student at Iowa State University, and Anthony Groe, 16, still in high school.

"As a precaution, I carry in my wallet the photocopy of my US passport in case I get stopped. I never used to do that, but you never know, you might be stopped for racial profiling," she says.

When she talks to her daughter, Bravo Groe warns her and her friends to carry a copy of their passports. They might encounter people "who are coming out of the closet now with their hate and racism," she says.

Her kids speak Spanish to each other. They're fluent. She speaks to them in Spanish, too. But now, after Trump's racist tweets, Bravo Groe believes things are spinning out of control:

"I'm really concerned about the news. I need to remind my kids that what happened to them back in 2015, the president is now saying the same things in public," she says. "If the president thinks that a congresswoman needs to go back, can you imagine all the people that voted for him? Do I need to go back because I'm the same as that congresswoman, a naturalized citizen?"

Bravo Groe says she's concerned about speaking Spanish to her kids in the supermarket. "Sometimes I feel I shouldn't. I don't wanna be yelled at, 'speak English, we're in America,'" she says. "I'm scared my kids are gonna get bullied if they speak Spanish in school."

She wishes she could take her daughter to Disney. Instead, she takes her to work

The 4-year-old girl talks about princesses all the time. She wants to meet Mickey Mouse and Jasmine from "Aladdin." But her mother, a 25-year-old undocumented Jamaican immigrant in New York City, says she knows traveling to Disney World would be too risky.

Most days, she thinks even playing outside with her toddler is too dangerous. Afraid of the possibility of immigration raids, the housekeeper and receptionist said she's started bringing her daughter to work more often to protect her. Living as an undocumented immigrant in the United States, she says, feels like living in a horror movie.

"The word 'ICE' in our community just sends us all into panic," she says. "I'm not able to do normal outdoor activities with my daughter, such as playing in the park, going to the library, even going for her doctor's visit, because of the fear I have of it being my last day with her in America."

The woman shared her story with CNN but asked to remain anonymous, afraid that publishing her name could make her a target of immigration authorities and leave her child without a mother to care for her.

She says her parents brought her to the United States when she was 17, fleeing from violence in Jamaica after her brother was kidnapped. Their house there has burned down. Now, she says, America is the only home they have.

It is a place where she's learned to survive, and the place where her 4-year-old daughter was born. But it's also a place where daily life fills her with dread. She says Trump's recent comments telling four congresswomen to "go back to where they came from" were a reminder that someday she will need to help her daughter deal with racism, too.

But right now she's facing something more pressing: a day she fears will inevitably come.

"I tried to make preparations for her just in case I'm not here, to leave enough money," she says. "I don't know what would happen to her."

She fears someone will strip away her kids' citizenship

Katalina Thomas was shaken by a sinking feeling at a moment when she should have been thrilled. Her aunt had surprised her with plane tickets for a family reunion. But Thomas says she was scared to go.

The United States, where she was born but her kids were not, seemed to be transforming into someplace unrecognizable -- a place where she was worried about her children's safety and afraid to speak Spanish in public.

Thomas is from Texas. She's the daughter of a Cuban refugee. Her husband and two children were born in Spain, where their family now lives. Her children are US citizens, but Thomas worries that's something the US government could try to strip away, even though the administration hasn't proposed such a move.

"I want them to have the opportunity to do everything they want in the world. There are these stories about people getting deported to countries that they don't remember and don't speak the language of. At the moment, they don't seem to be arbitrarily ripping citizenship from people, but there have been some court decisions," she says. "Your citizenship shouldn't be able to be taken away. ... It's concerning that those kinds of policies can change."

Thomas says she didn't sleep at all the night before they flew to the United States for the family reunion. She stayed up, pulling together all their documents in case US border authorities gave them any trouble.

"I didn't want to not have something that we needed, to prove that we were a family, to prove that we were citizens. ... It made me question my identity a lot," she says. "It's somewhere that I don't feel like my family's welcome. The simple act of going back for a family reunion to visit my family, to spend Christmas and things, was something I was dreading because I didn't know what could happen."

She's trying to protect her kids by hiding her fears

A mother in New York says she worries constantly about a question she doesn't know how to answer: What am I going to do?

Since an earthquake devastated Haiti in 2010, the 41-year-old security guard has been living legally in the United States, protected from deportation by a government policy the Trump administration has been trying to end.

So far, a federal court has temporarily blocked that move, but she worries any day it could end and her children -- a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old who were both born in the United States -- could lose the only life they've known. She shared her family's story with CNN but asked to remain anonymous because she fears speaking out could affect her immigration status.

It's impossible for her to imagine her children being forced to live a life in a country where they don't even speak the language. The thought of having to leave them behind is even tougher. She hasn't told them about the fear that's taken hold of her life since Trump became president.

"I don't want them to be really scared or think one time their mom's not going to be here anymore," she says.

She says Trump's recent comments have made her worry more than ever that her family is at risk.

"Thinking about this every day is really disturbing...this is the lowest I've ever been before," she says. "I've been in this country. I used to hear it from other people, but not from someone who was in power, who's supposed to teach people about diversity, including everybody ... It's just barbaric when you hear those things."

(CNN) - An Iowa man has been arrested by federal agents after he threatened to kill Jews in hate-filled phone calls and emails, according to court documents.

Garrett Kelsey, 31, admitted in a voluntary interview to calling and emailing a Jewish organization with messages full of anti-Semitic and racist language, the documents said. He was arraigned on Tuesday in a federal court in Iowa on charges of making interstate threats.

Kelsey was apparently upset about a video regarding Nordic neo-Nazis that the group had posted, the affidavit said.

"My people have f***ing slaughtered your f***ing people before and we will do it again. And right now, you are giving us incentive to do that. ... Filthy f***ing Jews," Kelsey said in a message to a Jewish organization based in New York, according to court documents.

Kelsey's profanity-laced email to an employee warned the group had three days to remove the video or "we will be taking action against your organization full of degenerates," the affidavit said. The Cedar Rapids resident also wrote that "everywhere Jews go in the world they cause trouble."

A Special Agent with the Joint Terrorism Task Force of the FBI who helped investigate the case detailed in the affidavit Kelsey's social media trail, which includes blatant use of anti-Semitic and racist language and Neo-Nazi tropes.

A week after the voluntary interview with authorities, the agent says Kelsey changed his now-deleted Facebook cover photo to one that depicts people lined up facing a wall with their hands up, according to the agent. The photo shows Jewish residents in a Warsaw, Poland, ghetto before being transferred to concentration camps, according to the agent.

Kelsey used the Facebook account to leave a message on the page of the group "Iowa Antifa" in which he threatened that, if he saw any of them, he would "bash your skulls in without warning!" according to court documents.

He then wrote "white is might!! 1488!!" according to court documents. 1488 is a Neo-Nazi reference: the 14 refers to the "14 Words" of a popular white supremacist slogan, and "88" refers to "Heil Hitler" (H is the 8th letter in the alphabet).

Kelsey was arrested and arraigned in Iowa and is scheduled to be in court for another hearing on Thursday, his public defender Christopher J. Nathan told CNN. Nathan would not comment further on the case. The case is expected to be transferred to New York for prosecution, according to prosecutors in Iowa.

Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement that the profanity-laced threats are "not protected speech."

FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. appeared to agree.

"The FBI will always follow threats that cross the line of free speech and threaten the safety of individuals and groups, especially when those threats are based on a religion or race," Sweeney Jr. said in a statement. "The fact that Mr. Kelsey allegedly continued his threatening behavior even after being informed that his previous actions were not protected speech makes his actions more abhorrent."

I’d made my own preposterous suggestion on the phone to the then Conservative celebrity-MP for Henley in the autumn of 2002.

After a few minutes of cajoling and gentle persuasion he relented and changed his mind. “OK, I’ll fight you,” said Johnson. “But you’ll have to promise not to break my nose.” I did, of course. Promise, I mean. Not break his nose.

I had been recruited to take part in a televised bout of “celebrity boxing”, live on BBC Two.

In the end, the British Boxing Board of Control had more sense than I and, for a fleeting moment, Johnson had at the time. The boxing authorities judged that a high-profile fight between two barely trained middle-aged amateurs might be “reckless and irresponsible”. The “fight” was cancelled.

Johnson had pulled out by then, in any case. Not through any lack of “bottle”. Everything I have seen, heard or read about the UK’s new leader suggests no great fear of physical or, for that matter, political or social risk.

He clearly likes the idea of himself as a bit of a battler, not one to retreat from a scrap.

“Man or mouse?”, he is fond of saying before some sudden boyish challenge to a friend or colleague - a game of “whiff-whaff” [ping-pong] on the table in his office, or a quick competitive sprint.

In an interview with the Daily Mail recently, he gave his favourite quote as: “It’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog.”

Nor did I detect then, or since, any conventional instinct to protect his dignity. Just the opposite. We had invited Johnson precisely because he cared so little for that. But he did, I think, feel it might seem a little ridiculous, even for him, to risk his profile in such a way before a live audience of millions, even for charity.

Incidentally, much later, as London Mayor, Johnson was said to have demonstrated his martial instincts by physically battling in a meeting room with David Cameron, like two overgrown schoolboys, for possession of a Treasury note setting out the available funds for transport in London.

Afterwards, as Andrew Gimson records in his biography of Johnson, both men claimed victory. We’ll never know the truth. It was, though, another glimpse into the deep rivalry underlying the outwardly friendly relationship between the pair.

At an uncertain and unstable time for British politics, for the economy and for the country’s place in the world, Conservative Party members have chosen a leader who defies almost every norm.

Any objective assessment of Johnson’s record, judgement and character throws up one perfectly legitimate doubt after another.

Yet his ability to connect with people (though not everyone and not all the time), to make them feel good about themselves and about him, is simply unique in public life. Whether at a feel-good time of national optimism, or, as now, a time of bitter division and much pessimism, it has turned out to be a gift which has helped carry him into Downing Street.

More than any of this, even though Boris Johnson’s depth of character may be little trusted by his critics and by quite a few of his supporters too, he made himself the leadership candidate most trusted by the deeply Eurosceptic Tory “selectorate” to deliver Brexit as promised and on time, on 31 October 2019.

At the time of writing, the most reliable verdict on that pledge is still: “We’ll see.”

So why Boris Johnson? And who exactly is he?

The first thing to note is that he is not actually Boris at all, despite the rare distinction in politics of being known universally by that single name.

He was born Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson on 19 June 1964. He chose to be called Boris and his family, friends and eventually everyone else have amiably obliged him.

For one so stereotypically English, his ancestry is surprisingly varied - a mixture of English Christians, Turkish Muslims and Eastern European Jews. His maternal great-grandfather was an Orthodox Lithuanian rabbi. His paternal great-grandfather was a Turkish political activist, Ali Kemal, who was apparently lynched after falling foul of the nationalists then in power. Boris, Sonia Purnell records in her biography, was the name of a Russian emigre friend of the family.

Johnson was born in New York City, and spent his earliest days with father Stanley and mother Charlotte in a home opposite the famous Chelsea Hotel, hangout of many famous rock stars of the time.

His father began a master’s degree in agricultural economics, and after what he has reportedly hinted to be an unsuccessful attempt to recruit him as a spy (undergoing “the most intensive training in clandestine techniques known to man”) he worked briefly for the World Bank in Washington DC, before he was sacked.

Apparently, being perhaps something of a block off the old chip, he submitted a suggestion for a $100m loan to build three pyramids and a sphinx to help the Egyptian tourist effort. It was an April Fool joke. His employers were not amused.

Back in the UK, Stanley and Charlotte raised a family: a daughter, Rachel, who recently joined the Liberal Democrats before defecting to the then Independent Group as a candidate for the European Parliament (more successful as a journalist than as a politician); Leo who did well in finance, and Jo, who worked in Downing Street as a policy thinker under David Cameron, and became a respected minister under Cameron and Theresa May. The siblings were ferociously competitive. Stanley’s ambition was to raise a journalistic and political dynasty, and he did.

Young Boris was at Eton, and the family living in Brussels, when his parents split. He doesn’t like to speak of that time, or its effect on him, but it was painful. Charlotte - a celebrated artist - subsequently suffered a serious mental breakdown and spent nine months as a patient in a psychiatric hospital.

So Boris Johnson’s early life cannot be described as easy, or pain-free. His now famous amiable, bumbling persona - a close copy of his father’s - has sometimes been described as a defence mechanism, concealing a sharp brain and a fine but well-disguised instinct for personal advantage.

At any rate, after a spell at Ashdown House boarding school, Johnson went to Eton with an academically prestigious King’s Scholarship. He became a contemporary of, among others, David Cameron - and a close friend to then Viscount Althorp (now Earl Spencer), brother to Princess Diana, and Darius Guppy who was later to be jailed for five years for fraud.

Boris Johnson's battles

Boris Johnson is to be the UK’s new prime minister.

What drove him to the top?
“I’m not going to fight you,” Boris Johnson told me, after a moment’s silence. “You’re huge!”
I’d made my own preposterous suggestion on the phone to the then Conservative celebrity-MP for Henley in the autumn of 2002.

Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, King's Scholar at Eton

At Eton, AB Johnson became  “Boris” - rather posh, very English, somewhat eccentric and the deeply distinctive, deliberately dishevelled character we know now.

He was also very clever - “brilliant” according to one teacher - and endowed with what has arguably become a strong sense of entitlement to both make up and play by his own rules.

He was a formidable debater, and became adept at deflecting awkward questions with non-committal answers (as any journalist who has interviewed him can testify).

The report from his housemaster makes interesting reading now. He wrote of Boris to his father: “I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception - one who should be free of the network of obligations which binds everyone else. Boris is pretty impressive when success can be achieved by pure intelligence, unaccompanied by hard work.”

His character - clever, capable of achieving impressive results though always very much on his own terms - was forming. Future opponent Ken Livingstone wrote an attack on public schools while Johnson was a pupil.

He wrote a reply in the school newspaper, recounted in Purnell’s biography, dismissing his future adversary’s arguments as “twaddle, utter bunkum, balderdash, tommyrot, piffle and fiddlesticks”. His distinctive vocabulary seemed to be forming too.

CNN) - Doctors have long mulled over using low doses of the hormone testosterone as a way to improve sexual function in some women, but evidence on its safety and efficacy has been somewhat lacking -- until now.

A paper published in the journal The Lancet on Thursday found testosterone to be effective for postmenopausal women with low sexual desire, and the treatment was safer when administered as a skin patch or cream, rather than orally.

Researchers reviewed 46 previously published reports of 36 randomized controlled trials involving testosterone treatment that were completed between 1990 and 2018. The researchers took a close look at how testosterone affected sexual function, cognitive measures, cholesterol and other health outcomes in the trials, which included 8,480 women ages 18 to 75.

The researchers wrote in the new paper that their review provides "robust support" for a clinical trial of testosterone treatment to be conducted in postmenopausal women.

"Further research is needed to clarify the effects of testosterone treatment in premenopausal women and the effects on musculoskeletal and cognitive health and long-term safety," they wrote.

The researchers found that, compared with a placebo or another hormone treatment such as estrogen, taking testosterone for at least 12 weeks significantly increased sexual desire, pleasure, arousal, orgasm, responsiveness, self-image and the frequency of satisfactory sexual events in postmenopausal women.

The data from those previous reports also showed that testosterone significantly reduced reported sexual concerns and distress among the women when compared with a placebo or another form of hormone treatment. As for premenopausal women, the only observed benefit in the data was a reduction in sexually associated personal distress seen in one small study.

When examining the various ways testosterone could be administered, the researchers found that a significant rise in "bad" LDL cholesterol -- and reductions in total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides -- was seen when testosterone was administered orally but not as a skin patch or cream.

There was also an overall increase in weight found with testosterone treatment, along with acne and hair growth, but "no serious adverse events were recorded," the researchers found.

'Not the magic bullet for everybody'

The new paper had some limitations, including that much of the data on sexual function was self-reported and that the definition of sexual dysfunction was not consistent across the previously published studies.

"Those of us from the sexual medicine world have been using testosterone for women off-label for a very long time, appreciating the fact that while there has been no FDA-approved testosterone for women, we have very good data to show that it is safe and it is effective in some women," said Dr. Lauren Streicher, a clinical professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine and medical director of the Northwestern Medicine Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause in Chicago, who was not involved in the new paper.

Yet testosterone is just "part of our toolbox" when it comes to treating sexual dysfunction in women, said Streicher, author of the book "Sex Rx: Hormones, Health and Your Best Sex Ever."

"Our toolbox has a lot of things in it, including talk therapy and different medications, and we welcome the idea that testosterone is going to continue to be part of our toolbox," Streicher said.

"It's certainly not the magic bullet for everybody, and even when it does work, it's generally in conjunction with things such as talk therapy," she said. After all, "libido is very complicated because it is so multifactorial. So when you look at all of the things that impact libido, it's never one thing: It's hormones; it's neurotransmitters; it's relationship; it's cultural norms; it's past experience. The list is extremely long."

In general, "there is a lot of debate among doctors" about whether adding testosterone to hormone replacement therapy for women helps them feel better and is safe, Channa Jayasena, a clinical senior lecturer at Imperial College London in England, said in a statement distributed by the Science Media Centre in the UK. He was not involved in the new paper.

"Traditional" hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, containing estrogen has "well-known benefits" for improving sexual function in menopausal women, he said.

"The message is that oestrogen-containing HRT should still be the treatment of choice for almost all menopausal women," Jayasena said. "However, testosterone could be added to HRT when menopausal women have sexual symptoms which are persistent."

'An urgent need ... to ensure gender equality'

More research is needed when it comes to testosterone for women, Dr. Rossella Nappi, of the IRCCS San Matteo Foundation and the University of Pavia in Italy, wrote in an editorial that accompanied the new paper.

"Many testosterone formulations are available to improve measures of sexual wellbeing including low sex drive and poor sexual function. However, currently, these compounds are available only as male formulations and their safety or adverse events, as well as their effect on general aspects of women's health, remain controversial because of scant published data," Nappi wrote.

Notwithstanding the new paper, additional research should look into the therapeutic role of testosterone for women through studies on the benefits and risks, she wrote: "In particular, there is an urgent need in the area of sexual medicine to ensure gender equality in treating effectively those women with female sexual dysfunction."

(CNN) - Actress Valerie Harper, perhaps most famous for her sidekick role on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and later her own spinoff about her character, "Rhoda," has been engaged in a years-long battle with brain cancer, and this week her husband, Tony Cacciotti, announced that doctors have recommended hospice care, which is offered at end of life.

Cacciotti wrote on Facebook that he could not agree because, he implied, that was the loving choice.

"I have been told by doctors to put Val in Hospice care and I can't [because of our 40 years of shared commitment to each other] and I won't because of the amazing good deeds she has graced us with while she's been here on earth," he wrote.

But he also hinted at his own struggles in saying goodbye. "For those of you who have been in this position, you will totally understand that 'it's hard letting go,' " he went on. "So as long as I'm able and capable, I'll be where I belong right beside her."

Very few of us will get through life without having to face a loved one's death. And chances are good someone else in our lives will have an opinion on how we handed the situation: Were we too emotional? Not emotional enough? Did we do "all we could"? Even those who get by without others' judgment can feel it from themselves. How many times have we heard someone say, after the fact, that they handled death "wrong"? As in, "I should have been there more" or "I should have said/done/been this"?

Keeping in mind that none of us can truly know what's going on in the household or marriage of another, those with a clear view of Cacciotti's situation may suggest that by denying his wife hospice -- which often involves nursing care and assistance in relieving pain -- however unintentionally, he may not be doing the the most loving thing.

Hospice, after all, isn't about sending someone away to die alone, the colder option for the unattached, as he seems to be saying (for one thing, home hospice exists). The spouse, partner, family members do not "go away" in hospice.

It is not abandonment. Far from it. Rather it's an acknowledgment, determined by a doctor, that the end is near and that treatments to forestall it will not work or will impair the quality of the patient's remaining days. It is about providing dying people -- usually those who a doctor thinks will live less than six months -- comfort and services to make the transition to death easier and less painful. It's not some kind of "sentence": If the prognosis changes or if a patient changes his or her mind about hospice, generally, treatments can resume.

Depending on what hospice care is being proffered to Harper, it may involve in-home care -- often a blessing for a caregiver who simply needs a little time away to tend to other life matters -- and counseling for loved ones. And it may include the option or suggestion of a hospital setting.

It is possible that Cacciotti's own admission "it's hard letting go" indicates a somewhat clouded judgment of what's actually best for his wife.

At the same time, while it's easy to judge Cacciotti's decision, it's very easy to understand it. How we handle another's death is about us, never more so than when it's up to us to make a call between life or death.

Death is very personal and very powerful.

It leads us to a reflection on our own lives, our own mortality, and that can be overwhelming for many, particularly those who are caring for someone at the end. Many people don't grieve; many people can't stop.

But it is worth considering: Is being with a loved one -- who may or may not, by then, even know your presence -- worth years of your own suffering as you sort through the choices you made under the duress of looming death?

As emotionally wrenching as it is to face the end, is forgoing attentive end-of-life care really the best thing for your loved one?

(CNN) - Three white University of Mississippi students were suspended from their fraternity after a photo showing them posing with guns in front of a sign memorializing Emmett Till surfaced earlier this week.

The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is also reportedly investigating.

The students in the photo, obtained by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica, were standing beside the sign outside Glendora, Mississippi, near the site where the African American 14-year-old's body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River in 1955 after he was tortured and killed.

The sign appears to be riddled with bullet holes, but it's unclear whether the students were connected to the damage.

The image was posted to the private Instagram account of one of the students in March, with the message "one of Memphis's finest and the worst influence I've ever met," the news outlets reported.

CNN is not identifying the students while we attempt to reach them for comment.

School officials knew about the photo since March

Jesse Lyons, a spokesman for Kappa Alpha, said the students were suspended Wednesday after the chapter's leadership was made aware of the photo the night before.

"The making of the photo was unrelated to any event or activity of our chapter," the fraternity's Ole Miss chapter said in a statement. "The photo is inappropriate, insensitive, and unacceptable. It does not represent our chapter."

University officials had learned of the photo in March after they received a bias report through the school's office of student conduct, said Rod Guajardo, a university spokesman.

The university police later reported the image to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which Guajardo said declined to investigate the incident because the photo did not pose a specific threat.

He said the university sees the image as "offensive and hurtful" but it does not represent a violation of the university's code of conduct.

"It occurred off campus and was not part of a university-affiliated event," he said.

"We support the actions made by the Kappa Alpha Order leadership in suspending the students involved, and we are aware that this decision is backed by its National Administrative Offices."

US Attorney Chad Lamar of the Northern District of Mississippi in Oxford told the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica on Thursday that information about the photo was referred to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division for further investigation.

Deborah Watts, Emmett's cousin and co-founder of the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation, said she saw the photo Thursday and doesn't know who may have vandalized the sign.

"It marks a pretty solemn spot. This marks the spot where Emmett was shot, lynched and beaten," Watts told CNN. "To see them standing there, smiling, is disappointing, but not surprising."

"When I think about that photo -- it's a motivator," she added. "It means our work is more important today than it has ever been."

A bulletproof sign will be installed

The sign has been vandalized on multiple occasions, and stolen at least once, according to the Emmett Till Memorial Commission -- the group responsible for the sign.

"Our signs and ones like them have been stolen, thrown in the river, replaced, shot, replaced again, shot again, defaced with acid and have had KKK spray painted on them. The vandalism has been targeted and it has been persistent," Patrick Weems, the group's executive director, said in a statement Thursday.

Weems did not discuss the photo or confirm whether the sign was damaged this year.

The first sign went up along the river in 2007. It was stolen the following year and was never found, Weems had said.

Eight years later, its replacement was riddled with bullet holes in multiple acts of vandalism. Last year, a third sign was put up near the river and was shot up 35 days later. A professor from nearby Delta State University found the sign defaced by bullet holes, Weems said last year.

A fourth sign -- a bulletproof sign -- is expected to be installed at the site soon, the group said Thursday.

"We believe it is important to keep a sign at this historic site, but we don't want to hide the legacy of racism by constantly replacing broken signs," the statement said. "The commission hopes this sign will endure, and that it will continue to spark conversations about Till, history, and racial justice."

What happened to Emmett Till?

The killing of Emmett Till in 1955 shook the nation and helped to fuel the civil rights movement.

Emmett had traveled to Mississippi from Chicago to visit his great-uncle when he was falsely accused of flirting with Carolyn Bryant, a 21-year-old at the time. Bryant and her husband, Roy, owned a grocery store in Money, Mississippi.

Days later, Roy Bryant and his half-brother, J.W. Milam, rousted the teen from his bed and ordered him into the bed of a pickup truck. They beat him mercilessly. Then they took his life by shooting him in the head. Emmett would have turned 78 years on Thursday.

To get rid of Emmett's body, his killers strapped a 75-pound cotton gin fan to his neck with barbed wire. That way he'd be weighed down when they threw his battered body in the Tallahatchie. It was found days later.

Bryant and Milam went on trial less than a month after Emmett's body was pulled from the river. There were witnesses who saw them. The men admitted they had kidnapped Emmett.

But Bryant and Milam were acquitted by an all-white jury. A year later, they confessed but double jeopardy laws prevented them from facing another trial.

Emmett's mother demanded an open-casket funeral and forbade attempts to hide his injuries. Gruesome photos of the boy's mutilated body spread across the globe, lending jarring visuals to the stories of violence and discrimination coming out of the South.

(CNN) - Supermodel and reality star Janice Dickinson reached a "very large settlement" with Bill Cosby's insurance company in her defamation case, her lawyer Lisa Bloom said at a press conference Thursday.

The defamation lawsuit began when Dickinson, 64, said in 2014 that Cosby had drugged and assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. Cosby's lawyer at the time, Marty Singer, accused Dickinson of lying about it, and Dickinson then sued Cosby for defamation.

"Truthfully, a settlement is a victory and a measure of justice," said Dickinson, who was flanked by her attorney.

Bloom said Dickinson will be "fully compensated for being called a liar" and is free to tell her story. The settlement amount will remain confidential, but Bloom described it as "epic" and later presented Dickinson with a bouquet of flowers and called this "her victory press conference."

Dickinson said she lost her innocence after the rape in 1982 and "nothing can replace the before and after."

"Let's stop yielding our power to the perp," she said, urging sexual assault victims to come forward. "Tell your story and stand up for your rights."

Cosby's spokesman blames insurance company

But Cosby's spokesman said the settlement was not an admission of guilt.

The insurance company AIG had settled the lawsuit despite Cosby's objections, spokesman Andrew Wyatt said.

"To be clear, AIG's settlement of this lawsuit has no bearing whatsoever on the merit of Ms. Dickinson's claims. Mr. Cosby has every confidence that, had the case proceeded to trial, a jury would have found that the statements issued by his former attorney -- statements which Mr. Cosby himself never spoke and which he played no part in preparing -- were not defamatory," he said.

Cosby, 82, was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault last year and is serving a three-to-ten year sentence in a Pennsylvania prison.

Those charges dealt solely with his assault of Andrea Constand, but Dickinson also testified at his criminal trial as a "prior bad acts" witness to show that Cosby had a pattern in his illegal behavior.

Dickinson's 2002 autobiography, "No Lifeguard On Duty," mentions the Lake Tahoe visit does not mention Cosby's alleged assault. But in court, she testified that Cosby gave her a blue pill over dinner, and soon after she felt had trouble getting words out and then was rendered motionless. She said that's when she was raped..

In April, AIG reached a settlement in a defamation case against Cosby filed by seven women. The plaintiffs in that case had all publicly accused Cosby of sexual misconduct and claimed that Cosby damaged their reputations through statements to the media.

At the time, Cosby said in a statement on Facebook that the AIG settlement was done "without my knowledge, without my permission and without my consent." He accused the insurance company of failing to defend him.

Wyatt made a similar argument in his statement on Thursday.

"This is the third example in recent months of AIG robbing Mr. Cosby of the opportunity to clear his name in a court of law, where evidence and truthfulness are supposed to be elevated above headlines and gossip," Wyatt said.

"AIG's apparent strategy to have Mr. Cosby tried exclusively in the court of public opinion has become clear, and its decision to settle each of these lawsuits over Mr. Cosby's objections is illustrative of AIG's bad faith.".

on (CNN) - When Boris Johnson's girlfriend Carrie Symonds joined the entourage of staff for his first speech as British Prime Minister, the waiting photographers went "bananas."

Until now, Johnson's 31-year-old girlfriend has done a pretty good job of staying out of the media spotlight -- rarely seen on the campaign trail and steering clear of historic moments like meeting the Queen.

Keeping a low profile as Johnson's girlfriend for the past 18 months is one thing. But doing the same as the Prime Minister's partner will prove more difficult.

From the couple's living arrangements (will she move into Downing Street?) to her involvement in diplomatic affairs (will she accompany him on foreign trips?), the British media has in recent days been in overdrive speculating on the unprecedented relationship.

For never in living memory has a UK prime minister had an unmarried partner while in office. Downing Street told CNN it did not know whether Symonds would be moving into the famous residence.

These are uncharted waters for the British establishment and Symonds' role will be largely down to personal preference. Unlike US first ladies, UK first partners have no strictly defined role.

"It's kind of made up as they go along, so it's very dependent on the personality of the particular person, said Professor Tony Travers, director of the Institute of Public Affairs at the London School of Economics.

Travers pointed to the way former prime minister Tony Blair's wife Cherie continued her career as a barrister and "was very much her own person with almost nothing to do" with her husband's job.

Meanwhile Theresa May's husband Philip stood by her side as she delivered her final speech as prime minister -- "he decided to have a supportive, low profile, and the press pretty much left it at that," said Travers.

A powerful political communicator

The new Prime Minister is also unusual for having a partner who had a political career -- long before she met Johnson. The daughter of Matthew Symonds, a co-founder of the Independent newspaper, and the paper's lawyer Josephine McCaffee, Symonds had a privileged upbringing in southwest London where she attended a private girls' school.

Symonds studied theater studies and art history at the well-respected University of Warwick, before working as a press officer for the Conservative Party in 2010 and quickly rising up its ranks.

She was part of the campaign team that helped to get Johnson re-elected as mayor of London in 2012.

At 29, Symonds became the youngest-ever director of communications at the party, and analysts say she's been crucial in tidying up Johnson's famously disheveled persona during the leadership campaign.

"Since she's come on the scene he's become a much trimmer figure, he's lost weight, he's had his hair cut ... he's definitely smartened up his appearance," said Caroline Wheeler, deputy political editor at the Sunday Times newspaper.

Symonds is a "very established political communicator," Wheeler added. "She'll know how to keep him on message."

Throughout the leadership campaign Johnson was "very careful" about whom he spoke to, said Wheeler, doing few newspaper interviews and shunning some of the major TV debates.

"He's been a lot more disciplined figure and lots of people have credited Carrie with that transformation," Wheeler said.

Symonds now works as a senior advisor to conservation charity Oceana, and her Twitter feed is filled with stories ranging from overfishing to banning trophy hunting.

Now some analysts believe she will have the PM's ear on the climate crisis and animal welfare, an issue that Johnson unexpectedly touched on during his inaugural speech.

"She'll influence policies, particularly the environment," said LBC radio broadcaster and political commentator Iain Dale. Johnson has been "talking a lot about climate change during the campaign," he said.

The 'taxi cab rapist'

Symonds has also spoken out about other issues important to her. Barely out of her teens, she spoke publicly about her encounter with John Worboys -- known in the UK as the "taxi cab rapist" who is thought to have assaulted at least 100 victims.

At 19, Symonds caught a lift with Worboys to her home in west London and during the ride he offered her alcohol -- much like the other spiked drinks he gave his victims. She said that as a result, she does not know what happened afterwards.

Symonds waived her anonymity in the case, telling a number of British papers about her ordeal. She also helped to launch a judicial review after the parole board decided Worboys was no longer a threat.

The review later found Worboys still posed a major risk to the public, and would remain in jail. The justice system had "let us down," Symonds wrote in the Evening Standard. "Finally we've been proved right."

Tabloid fodder

Today, Symonds is in British newspapers for different reasons.

At 55, Johnson is more than two decades older than Symonds, and still technically married to his ex-wife of 26 years Marina Wheeler, with whom he has four children.

The couple separated last year and reports of Johnson's alleged extra-marital affairs -- and children out of wedlock -- have long graced the pages of the UK papers.

Johnson has never publicly addressed the issue of his extra-marital children. CNN contacted Johnson's office for comment but had not received a reply at time of publication.

Given Johnson's complicated private life, his relationship with Symonds "has got all the ingredients for the type of thing tabloid newspapers love," said Travers.

But their relationship is also a reflection of modern Britain, said Wheeler. "There are lot of people who choose to live together without being married," she said. "And I think it's important that those who are running the country, reflect what many people in this country are doing."

The couple's relationship was put under the spotlight like never before during the leadership campaign after police were called to an argument at Symonds' south London flat.

Neighbors recorded Symonds telling Johnson to "get off me" and "get out of my flat." Police said that officers arrived and "spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well."

The incident raised questions about whether Britain's next leader owed the public an explanation for what happens behind closed doors.

"The British press is supposed to operate on a 'public interest' basis," said Travers. Meaning "does the prime minister's private life in any way impinge on their capacity to do their job?"

With the UK in the grip of its worst political crisis in decades, Johnson is under huge pressure to deliver Brexit by the October 31 deadline. The PM probably feels he can do without the extra focus on his private life.

The 24-year-old was driving west on US Route 466 in California, bound for a racing event in Salinas, on September 30, 1955, when his 1955 Porsche 550 Spyder collided with a 1950 Ford Tudor driven by a Navy veteran, Donald Turnupseed. In Dean's passenger seat was his Porsche mechanic, Rolf Wütherich, who survived the accident.

"The early death of James Dean reverberates to this day," said Bobby Livingston, executive vice president at RR Auction. "These images offer an intensely unique perspective of the crash location and the resulting carnage -- many of the photos taken only hours after the accident."

According to RR Auction, the black-and-white photo collection consists of 12 overhead views of the intersection where the accident occurred and 18 "ground-level" photos, nine of which have more up-close details of the aftermath of the accident and mangled vehicles.

Six of the photos have inside and outside views of Dean's Porsche. His racing number, 130, is prominently displayed on the back along with a "Little Bastard" decal.

On the back of the ground-level photos, "Wütherich vs. Turnupseed-Dean-Coulter" is written in pencil, referring to Wütherich's attempt to sue the insurance companies of both Dean and Turnupseed for a double fractured jaw and a severely torn left hip that required multiple surgeries, according to RR Auction.

The legal proceedings never came to fruition, with Wütherich returning to West Germany in 1957.

There's also a signed letter of provenance from Robert A. Coyle, the son of Robert Everett Coyle, who served as the attorney for Turnupseed and his insurance company.

"When the case was dropped, he was still in possession of the photographs and being a history buff, made sure they were not destroyed," the letter says.

The wrecked Porsche went on national tour as a highway safety exhibit, but it went missing while being transported from Florida to California, according to CNN affiliate WLS.

The Volo Auto Museum outside Chicago offered a $1 million reward for the wreckage and told WLS that it got a credible tip about the Porsche's whereabouts in 2014.

The man "said he was 6 years old at the time and was present as his father and some other men put the wreckage behind a false wall in a building in Whatcom County, Washington," museum Director Brian Grams said.

Grams said in 2015 that the man passed a polygraph test regarding the details of his story but did not want to reveal where the building was until he had a signed deal for a portion of the museum's reward money. The museum would pay that reward money only if it got legal ownership of the Porsche, according to WLS. However, the wreckage remains missing.

The Little Rock Zoo announced the death of its resident of over 31 years Thursday night. Gorillas like her typically live to be about 40 in the wild and 50 in human care, according to the National Zoo, but Trudy outlived them by more than a decade.

Brought to the Little Rock Zoo in 1988 from Buffalo with her breeding partner, Ollie, the two were the first gorillas exhibited in Arkansas, according to the zoo.

Most gorillas in zoos now are born in captivity, but Trudy was born in the wild. She was one of the last to be caught and brought into zoo captivity.

The western lowland gorilla is the most populous and widespread species of all gorillas, according to the World Wildlife Organization. Even so, their numbers are on the decline, with poaching and disease reducing their numbers by 60% over the last 20 to 25 years, according to the organization.

They can be found in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Gabon. They typically live in groups led by a silverback gorilla, according to the National Zoo, but Trudy bucked tradition.

Though she lived with all male groups, zookeepers said Trudy "ruled the roost."

She was described as spunky, with a mind of her own. The zoo said she was known for purring when it was time for food or when she saw someone she liked.

"There are so many memories, stories and anecdotes to share about Trudy. She is a cherished member of the Little Rock Zoo family. To say that she will be missed and that her absence is felt is an understatement. We are glad to know she had a good home with us here," said Little Rock Zoo Director Susan Altrui.

Who's who of Jeffrey Epstein's powerful friends, associates and possible co-conspirators
Updated 5:26 AM ET, Tue August 13, 2019
(CNN) - Jeffrey Epstein's death ends the criminal case against him, but his powerful friends and associates may not have heard the last of it.

US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman said the investigation of Epstein's alleged conduct, including a conspiracy charge, remains ongoing, and Attorney General Bill Barr similarly said the case will continue against anyone who was complicit with Epstein.

"Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims deserve justice and they will get it," Barr said.

In addition, Epstein's accusers asked a federal judge on Monday to invalidate the non-prosecution agreement that Epstein reached with prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office in Florida a decade ago, which would give authorities "greater power" to go after his alleged co-conspirators.

Given that ongoing investigation, CNN took a look at the notable figures connected to Epstein who have been named in sworn testimony, as well as the major political figures with ties to him.

Unnamed assistants

The federal indictment against Epstein says that he ran a trafficking enterprise in which he sexually abused dozens of underage girls between 2002 and 2005 at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida. He also paid some of his victims to recruit other victims, the document states.

He was charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors, and he had pleaded not guilty to the charge.

The indictment specifically alleges Epstein worked and conspired with employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with him.

The roles of three employees are laid out in the indictment, though they are not personally identified.

"Employee-1," based in New York, was directed by Epstein to communicate with victims to arrange their visits to his New York City mansion, the indictment says. This employee also sometimes asked the victim-recruiters to bring a specific underage girl for Epstein, the indictment states.

"Employee-2" and "Employee-3" were both assistants who worked for Epstein and both were also responsible for scheduling sexual encounters with victims ahead of his visits to his Palm Beach residence, according to the indictment.

It's unclear why the assistants were not named in the documents.

Other unnamed employees have similarly been noted in a draft version of a lawsuit that was expected to be filed by Jennifer Araoz, who said she was raped by Epstein when she was 15.

CNN usually does not name possible sexual misconduct victims, but is identifying Araoz because she came forward to speak publicly on a television news program and is named in the lawsuit draft.

Her draft complaint targeted Epstein as well as unidentified women called the "Recruiter," the "Secretary" and the "Maid," whom it dubs Jane Does 1, 2 and 3. The draft complaint said that the recruiter facilitated her "grooming" to be sexually assaulted by Epstein, and that the secretary and the maid would give her money after her visits to Epstein.

Ghislaine Maxwell

A series of documents unsealed last week accuse Ghislaine Maxwell, the British daughter of the late publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, of assisting Epstein in his sexual abuse.

At the heart of the documents are allegations Virginia Roberts Giuffre made in a 2015 defamation case. Giuffre said Epstein kept her as a "sex slave" and that he was assisted by Maxwell. Testimony from another woman in those documents also alleged abuse at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell.

The case was settled in 2017.

An attorney for Maxwell did not respond to CNN's request for comment on Friday. Maxwell and her representatives have previously denied she engaged in sexual abuse or sex trafficking.

In the court filings, Maxwell and her attorney portray Giuffre as an unreliable narrator, pointing to errors in certain dates and figures she provided. Giuffre has said the errors were mistakes.

David Boies, an attorney for Giuffre, said Friday that her lawsuit "exposed for prosecutors, and now the public, the scope and scale and ugliness of the Epstein/Maxwell sex trafficking ring."

Les Wexner

Epstein's longtime associate was Les Wexner, the CEO and founder of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. After Epstein's arrest on federal charges last month, Wexner acknowledged that Epstein was his former personal money manager and that he served as a trustee of the Wexner Foundation, the CEO's charitable group.

He said he severed ties with Epstein 12 years ago and denied knowledge of his criminal behavior.

"I would never have guessed that a person I employed more than a decade ago could have caused such pain to so many people," Wexner wrote in a letter to L Brands employees. "My heart goes out to each and every person who has been hurt."

Their connections ran deep, and Wexner gave Epstein "sweeping powers over his finances, philanthropy and private life," The New York Times reported.

Epstein even tried to get involved in the recruitment of models for Victoria's Secret's popular catalog, the Times reported. That troubled executives at the company, which used talent agencies to scout models. Wexner was alerted by executives and reportedly said he would handle the issue, but Epstein's involvement in trying to attract models continued, the Times reported.

L Brands' spokesperson said the board of directors has "engaged outside counsel to conduct a thorough review" at their direction.

"While Mr. Epstein served as Mr. Wexner's personal money manager for a period that ended nearly 12 years ago, we do not believe he was ever employed by nor served as an authorized representative of the company," an L Brands (LB) spokesperson said in a statement Friday.

Wexner has accused Epstein of misappropriating "vast sums of money" from him and his family, according to a letter to Wexner Foundation members. Wexner told members of his Ohio-based charitable group that he discovered the missing funds after cutting ties with Epstein in 2007.

"This was, frankly, a tremendous shock, even though it clearly pales in comparison to the unthinkable allegations against him now," said the letter, which was not signed by Wexner or dated.

One of Epstein's accusers said Epstein sexually assaulted her in Wexner's home, according to an affidavit filed in a New York court in April as part of a defamation lawsuit against attorney Alan Dershowitz.

Alan Dershowitz

Giuffre has accused Dershowitz, the high-profile attorney who was part of the legal team that negotiated Epstein's 2007 plea deal, of sexually abusing her.

Dershowitz has denied her claims and accused her of fabricating the allegations against him. He said in a statement that Friday's release of documents "categorically proves that Virginia Roberts (Giuffre) never had sex with me."

In April, she filed a separate defamation lawsuit against him, saying that he made "false and malicious" statements about her when he accused her of lying in making her accusations against him.

That case is ongoing, and Dershowitz has filed a motion to dismiss.

Prince Andrew

Giuffre has said that Epstein forced her to perform sex acts with a number of prominent men, including Prince Andrew, Duke of York, in 2001. In addition, another woman who said Epstein and Maxwell abused her said she was forced into sexual acts with Prince Andrew at Epstein's Upper East Side mansion, where Giuffre participated as well, according to the unsealed documents.

In response, a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: "This relates to proceedings in the United States, to which The Duke of York is not a party. Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue."

In a statement to CNN last month, the spokesperson said, "The Duke of York accepts it was unwise to have met Mr. Epstein in December 2010. The Duke has not met with Mr. Epstein since."

Donald Trump and Bill Clinton

Among Epstein's powerful associates are presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton.

"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy," Trump told New York magazine in 2002. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."

However, on July 12, Trump said that he threw Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club years ago.

"Jeffrey Epstein was not somebody that I respected. I threw him out. In fact I think the great James Patterson, who's a member of Mar-a-Lago, made a statement yesterday, that many years ago I threw him out. I'm not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein," he said.

A spokesman for Clinton said in a statement last month that the former president took four trips on Epstein's airplane in 2002 and 2003. The statement said they also had one meeting in a Harlem office in 2002 and that Clinton made a brief visit to Epstein's New York apartment with a Secret Service detail.

"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York," Clinton's spokesman, Angel Ureña, said in a statement posted to Twitter.

"He's not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade," the statement adds, "and has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein's ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida."

Bill Richardson and George Mitchell

Finally, the documents unsealed on Friday in Giuffre's lawsuit against Maxwell include allegations that Giuffre was instructed by Maxwell to have sex with former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and former US Sen. George Mitchell, among others.

In a statement Friday, Mitchell called the claim false, adding: "I have never met, spoken with or had any contact with Ms. Giuffre."

A spokeswoman for Richardson called Giuffre's allegation "completely false."

"To be clear, in Governor Richardson's limited interactions with Mr. Epstein, he never saw him in the presence of young or underage girls," spokeswoman Madeleine Mahony said. "Governor Richardson has never been to Mr. Epstein's residence in the Virgin Islands. Governor Richardson has never met Ms. Giuffre."

Employees at Epstein's prison cite mandatory overtime, 18-hour days as controversy brews
Updated 11:06 PM ET, Mon August 12, 2019
(CNN) - The suicide of Jeffrey Epstein is bringing attention to what employees say is a broader problem at short-staffed budget-constrained federal prisons where employees who aren't prison guards are doing guard duty and overtime shifts regularly.

Attorney General William Barr said Monday that "serious irregularities" were found at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, long thought to be a well-run facility that has been used to house high-profile prisoners who require highly secure conditions.

In the case of Epstein, at least one of the two employees on duty at the time was not part of the regular detention workforce but was filling in as a guard, according to a person briefed on the matter. The person's regular position is not publicly known.

Budget cuts and hiring freezes first put in place at the beginning of the Trump administration have taken a toll at law enforcement agencies including the federal Bureau of Prisons, employees say.

After years of complaints, Barr lifted the hiring freeze in April.

But employees say the measures the bureau has had to take to live with budget restraints have taken a toll, including at the MCC.

One of those measures used is called "augmentation" and allows for workers who were hired as teachers and cooks to be trained to fill in at posts normally manned by trained detention officers.

One of the guards who was on duty during Epstein's death was filling in for regular guards.

"It's due to understaffing. It's due to not having enough correctional officers," Serene Gregg, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3148, which represents employees at the MCC.

"They would be performing the functions of correctional officers," Gregg said.

The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment and referred to Barr's comments.

Push to put Epstein in general population

Epstein's attorneys, who spent as many as 12 hours a day meeting with him, had pushed the prison to move Epstein into the facility's general population, a person briefed on the matter said. One of the arguments they made was that he was doing well and that he could use an improvement in his living conditions.

Epstein's lawyers didn't respond to a request for comment.

The decision to move him from suicide watch occurred after the prison staff conducted daily psychological assessments and, according to the person briefed on the matter, determined it was safe for him to be returned to the prison's special housing unit, which is a section more restricted than general population.

When Epstein was taken off suicide watch on July 29, days after his first suicide attempt, he was returned to the facility's special housing unit, where normal protocol calls for him to be housed with a cellmate and to be checked on every 30 minutes.

Epstein's cellmate was moved out on Friday, a day before Epstein was found dead, a person briefed on the matter said. In the hours before his death was discovered, there were no checks made, the person said.

Both guards were working overtime shifts, but it's unclear whether that was mandatory. One person familiar with the matter said both employees volunteered. Union officials say that the overtime was mandatory.

Gregg claimed it's not uncommon at the MCC for employees to work 17-and 18-hour-days and are not allowed to refuse the mandatory overtimes.

"A lot of them are working mandatory overtime three or four times a week," Gregg said. "There's no one to relieve you at end of an eight-hour shift."

New York (CNN) - The jail cell death of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein over the weekend positioned prosecutors to pursue his associates, some of whom allegedly assisted him in abusing underage girls. On Monday, his accusers and law enforcement officials indicated they had taken the first steps toward doing so.

The US attorney's office in Manhattan has suggested it will advance the case by focusing on the conspiracy charge against Epstein, which accused him of working with employees and associates to operate a vast sex-trafficking ring involving dozens of girls. The conspiracy count could allow prosecutors to charge anyone else involved in the scheme.

Some of Epstein's accusers on Monday moved toward pursuing his alleged co-conspirators in a civil case: they asked a federal judge to unwind a nonprosecution agreement the alleged sex trafficker reached with Florida prosecutors a decade ago that immunized his associates.

Inner circle also under scrutiny unrelated to alleged sex trafficking

Members of Epstein's inner circle who have not faced sexual abuse allegations also appear to be bracing for further legal action.

The financial and personal relationship between Epstein and his onetime client and close friend, L Brands CEO Leslie Wexner, has attracted attention since Epstein's arrest, though Wexner has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

Now Wexner has hired one of the most prominent criminal defense attorneys in New York, Mary Jo White, who is a partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP and is the former US attorney in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the matter.

In recent weeks, one of these people said, White reached out on Wexner's behalf to prosecutors working on the Epstein case. Spokesmen for Debevoise and the Manhattan US attorney's office declined to comment.

Last week, Wexner wrote a letter to his charitable foundation saying that Epstein "misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family."

L Brands has hired an outside law firm to conduct an internal investigation. A representative for the company declined a CNN request seeking comment from Wexner.

Prosecutors will draw on Epstein evidence

As they pursue potential targets beyond Epstein, prosecutors will likely have the ability to use material they seized from a search conducted of his Upper East Side mansion in the hours after his arrest in July, according to former federal prosecutor Rachel Maimin, a partner at law firm Lowenstein Sandler LLP who helped prosecute the case against President Donald Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen for campaign-finance violations and other crimes.

During the search of Epstein's home, agents recovered a "vast trove" of lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls, dozens of electronic files, compact discs with labels that suggested they contained pictures or videos of people other than Epstein and other material in a locked safe, according to court filings.

"Others wouldn't have standing to object to it because they have no privacy interest in the property," said Maimin, adding that if prosecutors are contemplating new charges beyond conspiracy, they may choose to obtain a new search warrant for the material out of an abundance of caution.

On Monday afternoon, federal agents appeared to take new evidence-gathering measures. Agents from the FBI's New York office visited Little St. James, the island Epstein owns in the Caribbean, according to a spokeswoman for the bureau.

His death was a blow to Manhattan prosecutors

Of course, Epstein's death does put a stop to the case against him individually, a matter that was set to be one of the highest-profile criminal trials the Manhattan US attorney's office had undertaken in years.

Epstein's death is a blow to prosecutors at the Manhattan US attorney's office, where officials were highly invested in the case. In the months leading up to the indictment, prosecutors took "extraordinary efforts," they told the court, to keep their investigation of him secret so that they could prevent Epstein from evading prosecution.

A press conference after Epstein's arrest was punctuated by a dramatic moment when US Attorney Geoffrey Berman stepped out from behind the lectern and pointed his finger at an oversized photo of Epstein's face, imploring people to come forward "if you believe you are a victim of this man." As the case proceeded, a phalanx of senior leadership at the office attended each of Epstein's pretrial court appearances, with Berman arriving alongside the chief of the public corruption unit and his deputy.

But the case is far from over

Over the weekend, Berman signaled that prosecutors would not let the case expire, saying "our investigation of the conduct charged in the Indictment -- which included a conspiracy count -- remains ongoing."

That charge in the indictment accuses Epstein of having "worked and conspired with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with Epstein at the New York Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence."

The indictment alleges that when Epstein traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, "an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida."

The indictment describes, but doesn't name, a New York-based employee, as well as two other assistants it suggests were based in Palm Beach.

Multiple civil lawsuits filed over the years by various women who have accused Epstein of sexual abuse also allege that he was aided by a coterie of female assistants and employees, primarily a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell.

Maxwell allegedly procured underage victims for Epstein and at times herself engaged in sexual assault of minors. Maxwell, who hasn't made a public statement since Epstein was charged in July, has previously denied the allegations. Her attorney didn't respond to a request for comment on Monday.

Epstein's death also doesn't end a number of related civil cases making their way through the courts, including a defamation lawsuit filed by Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre against famed lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who once represented Epstein and with whom Giuffre has said Epstein forced her to engage in sex acts.

Dershowitz has denied those allegations, saying they were fabricated, and has filed a motion to dismiss her defamation case. A hearing in that matter is scheduled next month.

And there are additional court papers expected to be unsealed in a separate defamation case that Giuffre settled in 2017 with Maxwell. A judge has set a court date to discuss the unsealing on September 4.

On Monday, US Attorney General William Barr pledged that the Justice Department wouldn't let those who aided Epstein's alleged crimes walk away in the wake of his death.

"Let me assure you that this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein," Barr said during a speech in New Orleans.

"Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims deserve justice, and they will get it."New Orleans (CNN) - Attorney General William Barr said investigators are learning of "serious irregularities" at the New York jail where accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was found dead of an apparent suicide over the weekend.

"We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation," Barr told a national policing conference in New Orleans on Monday morning.

Barr said he was "appalled" and "angry" to learn of the Metropolitan Correctional Center's "failure to adequately secure this prisoner."

Barr announced on Saturday that the FBI and the Justice Department's internal watchdog would investigate Epstein's death.

Epstein's cell was not regularly monitored the night he was believed to have killed himself, and the two guards monitoring the unit he was held in were both on overtime, a source with knowledge of Epstein's time at the prison told CNN on Sunday.

The investigation into what went wrong in the Epstein case is focusing not only on the 24 hours before the suicide but also on wider systemic problems at the jail that have now come to light, a person briefed on the matter told CNN Monday.

At the end of the month, when Epstein was taken off suicide watch and moved back to the Special Housing Unit, jail officials notified Justice Department headquarters.

As part of the regular jail protocol he had a cellmate and the guards on duty were supposed to check on him every 30 minutes, but at some point, the cellmate was moved out, according to the source. And for a number of hours before his death Epstein's cell was not checked on, the source said.

Justice officials have now uncovered broader problems at the jail, which long was considered to be among the best-run facilities in the Bureau of Prisons system, according to the source.

It's not clear what else has been found but the person briefed on the matter said it goes beyond the 24 hours before Epstein's death.

Employees have complained about being overworked and having to work consecutive days of overtime. Of the two guards monitoring Epstein's cell, one was working a mandatory overtime shift and the other was working his fifth overtime shift of the week.

Justice Department officials now say the jail has suffered a breakdown in protocols for a period that goes back years, according to the person briefed on the matter.

On Monday, Barr said that the case against Epstein would continue. A spokeswoman for the New York FBI told CNN it has agents in the US Virgin Islands, specifically on Epstein's island, Little St. James, in connection with the Epstein investigation.

"Let me assure you that this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein. Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims deserve justice and they will get it," Barr said.

"For the last 3 years I have fully supported this President," tweeted the former White House communications director about his onetime boss and longtime friend. "Recently he has said things that divide the country in a way that is unacceptable. So I didn't pass the 100% litmus test. Eventually he turns on everyone and soon it will be you and then the entire country."

"Eventually he turns on everyone."

That might seem like an exaggeration made by a disgruntled former friend. It's not. For a man whose life has been defined, in large part, by his open embrace of his inconsistencies and contradictions, one of the very few things Donald Trump has been consistent about is that he goes from love to loathing quickly. If you are close to him (unless you are a member of his immediate family) you are on the clock. It's only a matter of time before he tires of you -- and turns on you.

Consider these names (and this is far from a complete list): Michael Cohen, Omarosa Manigault Newman, Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, Jeff Sessions, Steve Bannon, John Kelly, Paul Ryan, Cliff Sims, Donald McGahn, Chris Christie and Scaramucci.

All were once close to Trump. All were once publicly praised by Trump. And all are now on the outs with him, the result -- in virtually every circumstance -- of Trump finding fault with them, whether in how they were performing the job he had tasked them with or in how they defended him (or didn't) at all costs.

"I need loyalty," then-FBI director James Comey famously said Trump told him in the first week of his presidency. "I expect loyalty." And loyalty to Trump is blind fealty to him -- no matter the consequences or the law.

He turned on Sessions, one of his most loyal surrogates during the campaign, when as attorney general, Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. According to special counsel Robert Mueller's report, Trump repeatedly sought to get Sessions to un-recuse himself. At one point, Trump reportedly told Sessions this:

"AG is supposed to be [the] most important appointment. Kennedy appointed his brother. Obama appointed Holder. I appointed you and you recused yourself. You left me on an island. I can't do anything."

I, I, I. Me, me, me.

In the wake of Cohen's arrest on charges of tax evasion and other financial wrongdoing, Trump took to Twitter to praise Cohen as a "fine person with a wonderful family." Added Trump:

"Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked & respected. Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!."

Once Cohen agreed to a plea deal, Trump's tone changed. A lot. "If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen," he tweeted in August 2018.

I, I, I. Me, me, me.

Trump's worldview simply doesn't allow for people to remain close to him for any extended period of time. In the President's mind, the only person who lives up to his standards is him. Everyone else will, eventually, disappoint him. And when you disappoint him, he will turn on you. Every. Damn. Time.

It's why Trump has lost nine Cabinet secretaries already in his first term -- despite being only two-and-a-half years into it. It's why, according to figures kept by Kathryn Dunn Tenpas at Brookings, 75% of Trump's "A team" -- his top staffers across the government -- have left in his first term already. (Those numbers are significantly higher than the attrition rates for past presidents in their first terms.)

And it's not going to stop. Scaramucci is the latest victim of the Trump turn, but he won't be the last. This is a feature not a glitch of Trump -- and it has been his whole life.

Being in Trump's inner circle is (again with the exception of family members) a kiss of political death. You don't know exactly when he will turn on you. But you have to know he will do it.Texas has been a linchpin of the Republican Party's national strength for a generation. But in 2018, Democrats recorded their most significant gains in decades in the state's largest urban centers.

Now Texas Republicans face indications that the same recoil from President Donald Trump that has hurt the party in other diverse and well-educated metropolitan areas -- from suburban Philadelphia to Orange County, California -- could combine with growing racial diversity to move Texas from reliably red into a genuinely competitive state much more quickly than almost any analyst envisioned even a few years ago.

"Trump has sped everything up by four to six years," says Richard Murray, a University of Houston political scientist. For the Republicans, he said, "it's a deadly combination of rapid demographic change and the immediate political dynamics."

Texas remains a difficult, though not unreachable, target for Democrats in the 2020 presidential race -- in part because it's unclear whether any potential Democratic nominee other than Beto O'Rourke, who represented a House district in El Paso, would invest the massive sums required to truly compete in the state.

But the party's improving position in Texas' thriving metropolitan areas is creating the opportunity for it to seriously contest as many as five or six more seats in the US House, possibly recapture enough seats to regain a majority in the state House of Representatives and mount highly competitive races both against Trump and Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who is seeking reelection next year.

Republicans keenly recognize the risk they will face if the Democrats can consolidate or even expand their recent beachheads in the state's metropolitan areas, particularly because those areas are projected to cast an ever-increasing share of the state's vote.

"We had made the mistake for years of allowing Democrats to build up a set of strongholds in the major metro areas that they were then able to work from," says James Dickey, the Texas Republican Party chairman. "So it's incumbent on us to recover those gains and attack them right in the base of those strongholds."

The battle for the allegiance of metropolitan Texas is likely to be one of the pivot points in American politics over the next decade. Republicans have carried Texas in every presidential race since 1976, and with the help of favorable district lines drawn by the GOP-controlled state Legislature, have been able to count on big margins from its state congressional delegation -- where Republicans now hold 23 of the 36 seats -- as well as its two Senate seats.

It would fundamentally reshape the competition between the parties if Democrats can loosen the Republican grip on any of those prizes in Texas, especially its 38 Electoral College votes. And if Republicans can no longer count reliably on Texas -- or other Sun Belt states, including Arizona and Georgia, also being transformed by the same twin forces of urbanization and diversification -- it would represent a huge price for the Trump strategy of maximizing support among rural and working-class white voters that has strengthened the GOP in Rust Belt battlegrounds such as Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.

GOP losing ground in Texas cities

The key to Texas' political future is whether it finally follows the geographic realignment that has transformed the politics of many other states over the past quarter century.

Across the country, Republicans since the 1980s have demonstrated increasing strength among voters who live in exurbs at the edge of the nation's metropolitan centers or beyond them entirely in small-town and rural communities. Democrats, in turn, have extended their historic dominance of the nation's urban cores into improved performance in inner suburbs, many of them well educated and racially diverse.

Both sides of this dynamic have accelerated under Trump, whose open appeals to voters uneasy about racial, cultural and economic change have swelled GOP margins outside the metropolitan areas while alienating many traditionally center-right suburban voters.

In Texas, only half of this equation has played out. In presidential elections since 2000, Republicans have consistently won more than two-thirds of the vote for the two parties in 199 mostly white nonmetropolitan counties across the state, according to a study by Murray and Renee Cross, senior director of the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs. (Trump in 2016 swelled that number to three-fourths.) The GOP has attracted dominant majorities from those areas in other races, from the Senate and US House to the governorship and state legislative contests. Democrats consistently amassed big majorities in 28 mostly Latino South Texas counties, but they have composed only a very small share of the statewide vote.

The key to the GOP's dominance of the state is that through most of this century it has also commanded majorities in the 27 counties that make up the state's four biggest metropolitan areas: Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. Demographically similar places in states along the coasts and in the upper Midwest have moved consistently toward the Democrats since Bill Clinton's era. But in Texas, Republicans still carried 53% to 59% of the vote in those metropolitan counties in the four presidential races from 2000 through 2012, Murray and Cross found.

In the Trump era, though, that metro strength has wavered for the GOP. In 2016, Hillary Clinton narrowly beat Trump across the 27 counties in Texas' four major metropolitan areas. Then in 2018, Democrat O'Rourke carried over 54% of the vote in them in his narrow loss to Sen. Ted Cruz, Murray and Cross found. O'Rourke won each of the largest metro areas, the first time any Democrat on the top of the ticket had carried all four since native son Lyndon B. Johnson routed Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential race, according to Murray and Cross.

Looking just at the state's five largest urban counties -- Harris (Houston), Travis (Austin), Bexar (San Antonio), Tarrant (Fort Worth) and Dallas -- the change is even more stark. In 2012, Obama won them by a combined 131,000 votes. By 2016, Clinton expanded the Democratic margin across those five counties to 562,000 votes. In 2018, O'Rourke won those counties by a combined 790,000 votes, about six times more than Obama did in 2012. Along the way, Democrats ousted Republican US House incumbents in suburban Houston and Dallas seats and made substantial gains in municipal and state house elections across most of the major metro areas.

"We have now turned every major metropolitan area blue," says Glenn Smith, a longtime Democratic strategist in the state.

Growth explodes in big metro areas

Yet that, of course, still wasn't enough for O'Rourke to overcome Cruz's huge advantages in smaller nonmetro communities. That outcome underscores the equation facing Texas Democrats in 2020 and beyond: They must reduce the GOP's towering margins outside of the major metropolitan areas and/or expand their own advantage inside the metro centers.

Few in either party give Democrats much chance to record many gains outside of metro Texas, especially given Trump's national strength with such voters. O'Rourke campaigned heavily in Texas' smaller counties and made very limited inroads there, even relative to Clinton's abysmal performance in 2016. Exit polls conducted for a consortium of media organizations including CNN found that O'Rourke carried just 26% of white voters without a college education, only a minuscule improvement from the 21% Clinton won in Texas in 2016.

O'Rourke's very limited rural gains have convinced many Texas Democrats that while they can't entirely abandon smaller parts of the state, their new votes are most likely to come from the metropolitan centers.

"It's a matter of emphasis," says Smith, a senior adviser to the liberal group Progress Texas. "You've got to do urban/ suburban areas first. You've got to maximize your advantage there."

The stakes in the struggle for Texas' big metro areas are rising because they are growing so fast. While the four major metro areas cast about 60% of the statewide votes in the 1996 presidential election, that rose to about 69% in 2016 and 2018, Murray and Cross found. Murray expects the number to cross 70% in 2020.

And the concentration of Texas' population into its biggest metropolitan areas shows no signs of slackening. The Texas Demographic Center, the official state demographer, projects that 70% of the state's population growth through 2050 will settle in just 10 large metropolitan counties. Those include the big five urban centers that O'Rourke carried as well as five adjacent suburban counties; those adjacent counties still leaned toward the GOP in 2018 but by a much smaller cumulative margin than in the past. Overall, O'Rourke won the 10 counties expected to account for the preponderance of the state's future growth by a combined nearly 700,000 votes.

This urbanization is unfolding together with growing diversification. From 2010 through 2018, the US Census Bureau found, non-Hispanic whites accounted for only 14% of Texas' population growth; Asian-American growth roughly equaled whites', African Americans slightly exceeded both and Hispanics dwarfed all three -- they accounted for over 55% of Texas' population growth in that period.

An analysis conducted for a consortium of progressive groups similarly found that minorities will account for fully 88% of the newly eligible Texas voters between 2016 and 2020, with Hispanics alone accounting for 60%, according to sources familiar with the study. The Texas Demographic Center forecasts that Hispanics could supplant whites as the state's largest population group by as soon as 2022.

Most of that minority growth is occurring inside the state's big metropolitan areas, further accelerating their transformation: Harris County last year elected a 27-year-old Latina to its top countywide position and nearby Fort Bend elected an Indian American.

The challenges for Democrats

But the impact of this demographic change has been blunted by consistently low turnout for nonwhite voters in Texas, where Democrats and other liberal groups have lacked the funds to conduct meaningful voter drives for years, and GOP-passed laws, from strict voter identification requirements to limits on voter registration drives, have erected hurdles to greater minority participation. Only about one-third of eligible Hispanics turned out in 2018, the Census Bureau reported.

Democrats are cautiously hopeful that a backlash against Trump in minority communities will improve their turnout in 2020, particularly after a young white man echoed Trump's language of "invasion" before carrying out the recent mass shooting in El Paso.

"That's always this question I have been hearing since I got here: What is going to increase Hispanic turnout in Texas?" said Joshua Blank, manager of polling and research at the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Politics Project. "I think the idea of a white supremacist, in the political environment we're in, specifically targeting a majority Hispanic city like El Paso ... is likely to be a pretty good wake-up call. But we'll see."

It's possible that greater minority engagement could increase the nonwhite share of the Texas vote from the 43% that exit polls recorded in 2016 and 2018. But given Trump's ability to mobilize turnout among his preponderantly white non-urban base, even greater minority participation might be offset by high turnout among rural whites.

The sheer weight of the state's urbanization and diversification will eventually undermine a Trump-type strategy that focuses on maximizing the party's margins outside metro areas at the price of eroding its strength within them. But to close the gap in the next few elections, Democrats may need not only greater turnout but also slightly improved vote shares among their best groups: minorities and especially college-educated white voters.

In contrast to O'Rourke's limited gains among blue-collar whites, exit polls did show him improving substantially with those college-educated white voters: O'Rourke carried 44% of them, up from just 31% for Clinton two years earlier. The most recent Quinnipiac University Poll in Texas showed that among those voters only a narrow 52% to 43% majority approved of Trump's performance. Quinnipiac found a sharp gender gap, with 56% of college-educated white men approving of Trump and 54% of women disapproving.

Still, those numbers are notably better than Trump's showing with those college-educated white voters in most national surveys. And they reflect the challenge Democrats face expanding beyond the beachheads they have established in suburban Texas communities.

One is that more white suburbanites in Texas than elsewhere are evangelical Christians, perhaps the group now most staunchly supportive of Trump and the GOP. In 2018, the exit polls found that about 40% of college-educated white voters in Texas identified as evangelicals, and they backed Cruz by overwhelming margins, according to figures provided by Edison Research, which conducts the exit polls.

Also, as Blank says, whatever their religious affiliation, Texas suburbanites are marinated in a political culture much more conservative on almost all issues than comparable suburbs elsewhere. Democrats offering big new programs and higher taxes may still face more resistance in the suburbs of Texas than states such as California and Colorado, particularly among men.

"Regardless of the rapid demographic change that is going on in the state, it still maintains a pretty conservative political culture writ large," Blank says. "In a place like Texas, as opposed to some of these upper Midwest or Northeastern states, by no means does going to college here mean you are having an overwhelmingly liberalizing experience. Some of these schools are tied to rural Texas and Christianity: It is not like we have Yale and Harvard and Swarthmore down here."

Still, Blank notes, the diverse young families now filling the suburbs of Texas' largest metropolitan areas are very different from the predominantly white families who powered their first wave of growth after the 1960s: While those earlier suburbanites were largely fleeing racially diverse cities, their successors today want to remain close to the cities while securing more affordable housing. "Fundamentally, that's a different kind of mindset," he says, "and that's a mindset that tends to align more with Democratic Party values."

For 2020, both sides are preparing extensive voter-mobilization efforts targeted mostly at the major metropolitan areas. Dickey says the state GOP, which for years faced little effective challenge to its control, will launch a major organizational effort next year with both paid staff and volunteers to roll back the 2018 Democratic gains in the big population centers.

"The question is whether that was a trend or a dip," he says. "The answer is that depends on us. Will we do the work necessary to win back the geographic areas that we had as recently as 2014?"

But Murray says that in Texas, as in other states, Trump's racially divisive messaging leaves the GOP facing a stiff headwind in metropolitan areas growing mostly with minority and well-educated white voters. "Trump is killing the urban Republican Party," Murray says flatly.

If that proves true even in Texas, whether in 2020 or soon after, it will fundamentally reshape the national electoral landscape.

No, neither of these players are retiring, though Brown reportedly threatened to. They, along with other NFL players, are having to adjust to new helmets -- whether they want to or not.

"I've been experimenting with a couple different ones, and I don't really love the one that I'm in, but I don't really have much of a choice," Brady said in his Monday interview with radio station WEEI. "So I'm just trying to do the best I can to work with it."

The NFL and NFL Players Association are banning the use of some older model helmets this season to improve player safety. That means some of the league stars like Brady, Brown and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers are forced to make the switch. As of the final week of the 2018 season, 32 players (less than two percent of total players) remained in one of the prohibited helmets.

"You get used to the same helmet for a long period of time," Brady, starting his 20th season as the New England Patriots quarterback, said. "My last helmet, I wore it the last four Super Bowls, so it was a pretty great helmet for me. I hated to put it on the shelf. It's kind of what I'm dealing with."

Players aren't allowed to play or practice unless they have approved helmets. That didn't sit well with Brown. The Oakland Raiders wide receiver, who is in his 10th season, wanted to use the same helmet he's worn his entire career. He took his case to an arbitrator, who was jointly approved by the NFL and the players' union. The ruling went in favor of the league.

"While I disagree with the arbitrator's decision, I'm working on getting back to full health and looking forward to rejoining my teammates on the field," Brown said in a tweet. "I'm excited about this season appreciate all the concerns about my feet!"

Brown suffered frostbite on his feet doing cryotherapy. On Saturday, following their preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, Raiders head coach Jon Gruden said he hopes to have him available this week.

"We hope Antonio is back here soon because he's exciting to be around," Gruden said. "I'm excited, I have some plays for him. I hope I can start calling them."

Malaysian police told reporters on Tuesday that a Caucasian female body had been found in the forest surrounding the resort where the 15-year-old was on holiday with her family, according to Britain's Press Association (PA) news agency.

An official explained that the body, which he said "resembles Nora", had been winched by helicopter to the hospital, PA reported. Quoirin's family were going to the mortuary to undertake an identification, he added.

Search teams had been scouring the rainforest surrounding the Dunsun resort since Quoirin, who has a learning disability, was found to be missing from her bedroom on Sunday, August 4.

The Lucie Blackman Trust (LBT), which has been assisting the girl's family, also confirmed the discovery and said that an investigation was underway.

"At this time we cannot confirm it is Nora. However it sadly seems likely," The Lucie Blackman Trust (LBT) said in a statement seen by CNN on Tuesday.

LBT said that an update would be given "as soon as possible" and asked for the family to be given privacy.

Quoirin, whose mother is from Belfast and whose father is French, was traveling on an Irish passport during the trip.

Her parents offered a £10,000 ($12,000) reward for information leading to the return of their daughter, after receiving a donation from an anonymous business in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It came after Quoirin's family crowd-funded donations which exceeded £100,000 ($120,000).

"Nóra would not know how to get help and would never leave her family voluntarily," her aunt wrote in the appeal. "Nora is a child with special needs and has learning and developmental disabilities which make her especially vulnerable and we fear for her safety."

The resort, where the family was staying, is in a remote area 800 feet above sea level in the Titiwangsa mountain range. It contains six houses, each surrounded by rainforest, and has capacity for just 20 guests.

The comedian on Monday told her social media followers that there have been recent attempts to extort her over an image she accidentally and briefly posted to Instagram earlier this year in which part of her breast was visible.

"In April I accidentally posted an insta story that showed nipple," she said on Twitter. "Once I realized, I deleted. The people who took screen grabs are trying to get money from me, some said they have offers to sell them, some are asking for money to not post the photo."

On Facebook, she shared a screencap of one private message in which a person asked Cummings how much money he or she would receive if they did not share the photo.

"When a woman in the public eye is extorted, we have to spend time, money and energy dealing with it, hiring lawyers and security experts, and living with a pit in our stomach about when and how we will be humiliated," Cummings wrote on Twitter. "Y'all can have my nipple, but not my time or money anymore."

Cummings did not share the identities of any of the people she says were attempting to get money from her "because some of them might be dumb kids."

More than 30 states and the District of Columbia have laws against nonconsensual disclosure of sexually explicit images and videos. And at least 12 states have civil laws that pertain specifically to nonconsensual image sharing.

Hong Kong (CNN) - Hong Kong's airport has been thrown into chaos for the second day in a row, with all check-ins suspended and dozens of outgoing flights canceled.

Thousands of protesters blocked security gates at one of the world's largest travel hubs on Tuesday, with some passengers struggling to get through the demonstrators to their gates.

At 5 p.m. Hong Kong's Airport Authority announced that all check-in services would be suspended for another night, due to terminal operations being "seriously disrupted."

"Members of the public are advised not to come to the airport," the authority said in a statement. All outbound flights which have not yet completed the check-in process have been canceled.

Inbound flights are mostly expected to continue to operate as scheduled.

It followed a night of chaos at the airport Monday when dozens of outgoing flights were canceled after thousands of protesters arrived to protest police violence during protests on Sunday.

Many passengers were left stranded with little information as to their situation with some even spending the night in the airport on the chance they would get a flight out.

On Tuesday morning, Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam warned that the city was on "the brink of no return" and said it would take a long time to recover from the recent mass demonstrations.

"The only thing we have to do is to go against violence, and rebuild the city," said Lam.

In an unusually strong statement, Hong Kong company Swire Pacific, who own flagship airline Cathay Pacific, have called for the "restoration of law and order" in the city.

"We must act now to stop the violence and preserve the stability, peace and prosperity of Hong Kong," the statement said.

World transport hub grounded

Last year, Hong Kong's airport handled 74.7 million passengers -- an average of about 205,000 per day. But on Monday, the airport was brought to a standstill as protesters occupied parts of the airport.

Confused tourists were left unsure of what was happening as shops, restaurants and check-in counters closed. Trains and buses heading into the city were packed with people, and the one available information desk was staffed by frazzled looking workers.

After the numbers of protesters dwindled overnight, more began to pour into the airport from early on Tuesday morning, chanting slogans and putting up signs.

When feared police action failed to materialize on Monday night, protesters said they felt the airport was a safe place for them to demonstrate. "We feel this is more safe to just sit and say what we want. It's more safe than going outside," one female protester said.

Disagreements occasionally broke out between passengers and protesters. Two men -- one of whom was wearing a cap emblazoned with a Chinese flag -- were seen arguing with protesters in the arrivals hall, before being ushered away by security as protesters cheered.

Another passenger -- who appeared to be from mainland China -- told protesters that they were causing inconvenience for others.

After the widespread cancellations were announced Tuesday, passengers who had been preparing to head to the airport were frustrated and confused.

Waiting at Hong Kong subway station, a 33-year-old French man who lives in Hong Kong, Loic, said that he didn't know if his flight was canceled. "I don't know what I can do. Maybe I can go to Shenzhen," he said.

But despite the days of disruption, some locals were still supportive of the protesters. "It touched me to see Hong Kong like this, I'm not angry," a 31-year-old passenger, who asked not to be identified, told CNN. "I still support them."

Why Hong Kong is protesting

Hong Kong's protest movement kicked off in earnest in June, sparked by a bill that would allow extradition to China.

Since then, the protests have expanded into something bigger, with protesters now demanding greater democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.

The protest movement -- that on Sunday passed its 10th straight weekend of demonstrations -- has seen protesters and police clash numerous times, with police firing multiple rounds of tear gas.

Beijing, meanwhile, has criticized the actions of the protesters. On Monday, a top Chinese official said the protests "had begun to show signs of terrorism."

Swire Pacific, one of Hong Kong's richest family-owned business empires, issued a strongly worded statement on Tuesday. The company condemned "illegal activities and violent behavior" and threw its support behind Hong Kong's beleaguered government.

"Swire Pacific is deeply concerned by the ongoing violence and disruption impacting Hong Kong," the company said in a statement, offering its full support for Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the city's police "in their efforts to restore law and order."

The company's CEO is billionaire Merlin Swire. The family's business empire dates back more than 200 years and has had roots in Hong Kong for much of that time. It owns luxury hotels, office towers and high-end shopping malls in the city.

Swire is also the largest shareholder in Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's flagship airline that has become a high profile casualty of the turmoil. Swire said it fully supports the carrier's "strict implementation" of new restrictions on the airline handed down by China's aviation authority over the weekend.

The statement came as hundreds of protestors crowded into Hong Kong's international airport, disrupting flights for the second day in a row.

Cathay has canceled more than 270 flights over the last two days. Shares in the carrier have fallen nearly 14% this month.

Property tycoon: Time to "think deeply"

Sun Hung Kai Properties, which is controlled by Asia's third richest family, the Kwoks, also called Tuesday for demonstrators to stop the violence. The real estate developer called for the restoration of social order and voiced support for Hong Kong's government and Lam.

Property tycoon Peter Woo, the former chairman of developer Wheelock & Co., also called on protesters to ease off, saying they already notched a victory by getting the government to shelve a controversial extradition bill that originally sparked the protests.

"It's time to think it over," Woo said in a statement Monday. "Opposition to the extradition bill was the 'big tree' of this movement. But this one, big appeal was accepted by the government on July 9. So the tree has already fallen." Some people are using the issue to "purposely stir up trouble," he added.

Hong Kong has some of the most expensive real estate on the planet, but the protests are now threatening its economy. City officials have warned that the disruption could have a more lasting impact than the outbreak of the deadly SARS virus in 2003 that slashed the lucrative tourist trade. Real estate, among other industries, could take a major hit.

Why Hong Kong is protesting

Hong Kong's protest movement kicked off in earnest in June. It was sparked by the extradition bill, which many feared could be used by Beijing to crush dissent.

Since then, the demonstrations have expanded into something bigger. Protestors are now demanding greater democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality. The protest movement — now entering its 11th week — has seen protesters and police clash numerous times.

Hong Kong (CNN) - Out-of-control mobs beating up police. Crazed separatists throwing petrol bombs and vandalizing government buildings. The symbols of the country insulted and humiliated. Local authorities overwhelmed and in need of assistance.

This is the picture consumers of Chinese state media have been receiving of the Hong Kong protests, now approaching their 11th consecutive weekend. While there is some truth to it -- there have been numerous incidents of violence, and protesters have targeted Chinese flags and government buildings -- it remains a highly selective and incomplete take.

Crucially, it appears to distort the reasons behind the unrest. Protests were initially sparked by opposition to a now-shelved extradition bill, but have since expanded to include demands for an investigation into police brutality and long-running calls for greater democracy and political reform.

It also ignores the many peaceful marches and the reciprocal, seemingly self-perpetuating cycle of violence, with both protesters and police deploying increasingly forceful tactics.

While many Hong Kongers are concerned about the escalating violence, and many have been inconvenienced by transport shutdowns and other travel disruptions, there is little sense of danger in the city beyond the protest front lines, and it is certainly far from the war zone often depicted in Chinese state media.

The presentation of the protests in mainland China -- where propaganda combines with the vast online censorship apparatus of the Great Firewall to allow the government to construct a narrative of its choosing -- has evolved significantly over the past two months.

Initially, almost all mention of the protests was censored, as is usual for anti-government action anywhere in China. Stories that did appear played up local support for the now-shelved extradition law, and framed opposition to it as a minority.

As the movement evolved, however, so too did Chinese state media coverage.

Violent clashes between police and protesters, beginning on June 12 when crowds effectively shut down the city's legislature and police cleared them with heavy force, were given sudden prominence and distributed widely.

A one one-sided narrative was constructed in which protesters, now labeled "violent mobs," were solely responsible for the escalating conflict. This was soon joined by allegations -- including from senior Chinese officials -- that Washington and other foreign governments were "meddling" in the protests and using them as a vehicle to attack China.

As the protests continued, violent mobs became "criminals" and "separatists," pursuing not greater democracy or an investigation into police violence, as they have demanded publicly, but Hong Kong independence.

On Monday, this gradual rhetorical escalation reached a new stage, with Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, China's top body in charge of affairs in the city, saying the protests showed "signs of terrorism."

"Hong Kong's radical demonstrators have repeatedly attacked police officers with extremely dangerous tools," he said. "They have already constituted serious violent crimes and have begun to show signs of terrorism. This is a gross violation of the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong, which is endangering the lives and safety for Hong Kong citizens."

On the same day, amid images of chaos coming out of Hong Kong's paralyzed international airport, Chinese state media broadcast images of the People's Armed Police (PAP) conducting drills in the neighboring mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen, in an apparent message to a domestic audience that the force stood poised to assist in crushed the protests. Some videos included subtitles highlighting relevant Chinese law that the PAP, which is under the direct control of the Central Military Commission headed by President Xi Jinping, can be used to "handle riots, unrest, severe violent criminal activities, terrorist attacks and other public safety incidents."

Worrying signal

Lev Nachman, an expert in social movements in Hong Kong and Taiwan at the University of California, Irvine, said that while Yang's use of the caveat "signs of terrorism," rather than outright saying protesters were terrorists, was something of a silver lining, it suggested "harsh repression by the regime is now no longer off the table, especially if protests continue."

"Evoking terrorism is rhetorical groundwork for escalation, it gives the Communist Party room to continue down this loaded line of 'terrorism' discourse that has the potential to justify whatever violence they deem necessary to stop whatever the 'terrorist' threat is," he said. "It almost feels like a threat from Yang Guang to the protesters that they are approaching a level of disruption that the (Party) no longer finds acceptable."

Under Hong Kong's de facto constitution, the government can request the assistance of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrison in the city for the "maintenance of public order." However, experts agree that the deployment of the military to the streets of Hong Kong could massively backfire on the government, leading to comparisons to the Tiananmen Square crackdown of 1989 and potentially crashing the economy.

For its part, the Hong Kong government seemed to downplay China's descriptions of the protests, with Senior Superintendent Steve Li saying "based on the current situation, we will handle it as violent protest."

Previously, local officials have also distanced themselves from Chinese propaganda about foreign forces controlling the protests. A senior Hong Kong government official told CNN they had "no evidence" of overseas interference, and pointed to local concerns as the chief driver of the protests.

Chinese state media, on the other hand, took the terrorism line and ran with it. State broadcaster CCTV accused protesters of attempting to murder police and said the unrest "obviously has the color of terrorism" which required the government to "resolutely crack down."

Official news agency Xinhua played up comments by an official in Hong Kong that the city risked sliding "into a bottomless abyss if the terror atrocities are allowed to continue," while an editorial in the nationalist tabloid Global Times said "raging mobs" must be "receiving support through nefarious political gain or financial stimulation" and were "without any doubt, similar to terrorists."

Yaqiu Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the terrorism framing was "extremely concerning."

She pointed to the use of "vaguely and broadly defined 'terrorism' charges" to justify widespread repression in Xinjiang, a region in northwest China with a large Muslim minority. Beijing has been accused of running a huge network of detention camps in Xinjiang, with potentially millions of mostly Uyghur Muslims being processed for "re-education."

Uyghurs have been the chief target of the "terrorist" designation in China, part of a general othering of the non-ethnically Chinese minority which has gone hand in hand with greater repression in the region. Suggesting that Hong Kongers, almost all of whom are Han Chinese, are also terrorists would be a major shift in how Beijing views the city and its relationship to the Chinese metropole.

The World Uyghur Congress, a Germany-based NGO highly critical of China, also said it was "tremendously concerning" that the government was using the term terrorism with regard to Hong Kong.

However, Wang noted that "the contexts of Hong Kong and Xinjiang are vastly different, to launch a 'Xinjiang-style' crackdown in Hong Kong would be hard to do and very costly to Beijing, for reasons such as Hong Kong is a major financial center in Asia and the residents are very digitally connected."

"The extraordinary activism demonstrated by Hong Kong people in the past three months has shown their resolve and competence in defending their freedoms and rights," she said. "Beijing should take note of that."

The Finland-based company expects a weaker dollar and slower economic growth in the U.S. and parts of Europe to dampen the overall handset market this year. About half of Nokia's (NOK) sales are in dollars or currencies tied to it; a weaker dollar makes imports more expensive.

"What spooked us was its outlook for the industry in general," said Rick Franklin, equities analyst at Edward Jones.

Nokia reiterated projections that the industry shipments of handsets will grow 10% this year over last. In the first quarter, though, global shipments rose 17%, suggesting a slowdown in the remainder of the year.

For the quarter that ended March 31, Nokia earned $1.9 billion (1.2 euros), up 25% from the same quarter last year but short of an expected $2.3 billion. Overall sales rose 28% to $20.1 billion (12.6 billion euros), roughly in line with views.

The decision to cancel all departures and inbound flights not already in the air on Monday afternoon was made after thousands of pro-democracy protestors gathered at the airport, the region's third busiest after Beijing and Tokyo.

The disruption ran into a second day Tuesday when all outbound flights were canceled late afternoon because of a large protest at the airport.

Protests have been rocking Hong Kong for months, and the crisis is already having a noticeable effect on the city's economy. Some demonstrations have ended in violent clashes with police.

The airport shutdown is a stark reminder of the risk to global businesses and the city's tourism sector.

More than 74 million passengers traveled to and from the airport last year. It handles 1,100 passenger and cargo flights each day, and serves about 200 destinations around the world.

The airport contributes 5% to Hong Kong's GDP, directly and indirectly, said Frank Chan, Hong Kong's transport secretary, in May.

"This is a disaster for Hong Kong that will cost tens of millions of dollars," said Geoffrey Thomas, editor in chief and managing director of AirlineRatings.com, a website that monitors airlines.

The direct impact of Monday's suspension isn't the only problem, he said.

"Travelers for months to come will cancel and rebook with other airlines to avoid Hong Kong as a hub," Thomas added.

Hong Kong is home to seven Fortune Global 500 companies, including Lenovo and CK Hutchison, and it operates as a regional base for big corporations and major banks that prize its semi-autonomous legal system and close ties to mainland China.

Companies have already reported "serious consequences from the disruption," including lost revenue, disrupted supply chains and shelved investments, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said last month.

Fewer visitors, less business

Hong Kong's status as a hub for business travel was already under threat before the protests began.

More business travelers are taking direct flights to mainland China instead of stopping over in Hong Kong, according to a February report compiled by the Hong Kong Tourism Board.

It's still too early to assess the economic impact of Monday's shutdown, said Eleanor Wan, the CEO of BEA Union Investment Management, an investment firm based in Hong Kong.

But she added that the airport closure will have a "negative psychological impact," noting that several countries have already issued travel warnings for the city.

"I'm afraid there will be even fewer visitors coming and fewer hotel bookings," Wan said. She also pointed out that Hong Kong hosts many conventions that keep its hotels and conference centers busy.

Some flights had resumed earlier Tuesday before the latest cancellations happened. But the city's image has already suffered.

"This will severely damage its reputation and it will take a long time to recover," said Thomas, the aviation expert.

The turmoil could also give rivals a leg up. Thomas pointed to places like Singapore as an alternative gateway to China and the rest of Asia that could benefit from Hong Kong's problems.

Cities in mainland China, including Shanghai and Shenzhen, have also gradually developed major financial markets of their own.

If 2020 turns out to be a referendum on Trump's overall performance, he's an underdog. Trump, though, would up his odds significantly by winning over half of the 9% of voters who like him on the economy but not overall -- and he would be a clear favorite if he won the votes of all those who approved of him on the economy but not overall.

So how can Trump pull of this feat? A look at the numbers suggests he'll likely need to do something very different than continue with his current base-first, hardline-immigration and racial-resentment electoral strategy. Trump will probably need to appeal well beyond his older, less educated and white Republican base.

This largely conforms with an earlier analysis by the left-leaning group Navigator Research.

The Trump base (i.e. those who approve of him overall) is overwhelmingly Republican. In total, 88% of voters who approve of Trump say they are either Republican or independents who lean Republican. This is why Trump seems loath to do anything that can alienate Republicans. They are his bedrock. A mere 7% of voters who approve of Trump are Democrats or independents who lean Democrattic. The other 6% are independents who lean toward neither party.

Those who approve of Trump on the economy, but not overall are something else altogether. In an aggregate of our last three CNN polls, 66% say they are Democrats or independents who lean Democratic. Only 23% are Republicans or independents who lean Republican. This makes this group not only more Democratic leaning than the overall Trump approval group, but puts it to the left overall electorate overall.

If Trump wants to reach these voters, he'll need to move beyond appealing to just Republicans.

The differences between these two groups is not just about party, however. It's about demographics as well.

Nearly four-fifths (79%) of Trump approvers are white. Just 2% are black and 9% are Latino. This could help explain why Trump hasn't seen much of a decline in his approval ratings when he makes racist statements.

But while Trump's approval rating hasn't declined, it hasn't gone up much recently, either. It could be because whites make up a significantly smaller portion (61%) of those who disapprove of Trump overall yet do approve of him on the economy. Black voters, on the other hand, see this share rise to 18% among this group. (This is actually larger than their 11% of all voters in our sample.) Latinos jump a little to 14% of the approve on economy though not overall group of the electorate.

This lends itself to the idea of something I noted a few weeks ago: Trump is hurting his chances at reelection with racist statements. He'd be much better off touting his economic record.

Another group Trump would be wise to reach out to would be voters with a college degree.

One of Trump's most foretelling statements of the 2016 campaign occurred when he said, "I love the poorly educated." 70% of those who approve of Trump's overall performance lack a college degree. But if wants to convert some of the people who disapprove of him overall but like him on the economy, he better start to want to win over some better educated folks. Among this group, the non-college share drops to 58%. To put this in perspective, this means that not only is this group more educated than Trump approvers but, also among the overall electorate (58%).

Age, though, is perhaps the most fascinating attribute of those who approve of Trump on the economy but not overall. The median age of Trump approvers is 52. This is older than the age of the median voter overall (50). Not surprisingly, it's also older than the age of the median Democrat or Democratic leaning independent (48). The median age of those who approve of Trump on the economy but not overall is younger than all of these (44). That is, the age gap between Trump approvers and those who approve of Trump on the economy but not overall is double the age gap between Democrats and Trump approvers.

These numbers suggest that either party that gears its message towards older voters could, in fact, be missing a golden opportunity to reach a swing part of the electorate.

Moreover, if Trump views politics through what he sees on cable news, he should keep in mind that the group of voters he may need to win reelection are not anywhere close to cable news' main demographic.

More importantly, these numbers suggest that either party that gears its message towards older voters could, in fact, be missing a golden opportunity to reach a swing part of the electorate.

Trump, for now though, seems more than happy to mostly double down on his base first strategy. It could be the downfall of his bid for a second term.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to confirm widespread international speculation that the accident -- which claimed the lives of at least five nuclear specialists last Thursday -- involved a nuclear-powered cruise missile known as the Burevestnik or Skyfall.

But in a conference call with reporters, Peskov denied that such mishaps would set back Russian efforts to develop advanced military capabilities.

The spokesperson said that only experts could speak with authority on such matters, but added: "Accidents, unfortunately, happen. They are tragedies. But in this particular case, it is important for us to remember those heroes who lost their lives in this accident."

Peskov then repeated an assertion by President Vladimir Putin that Russian efforts to develop such technologies remained "considerably far ahead of the level other countries have managed to achieve."

He also responded to a tweet by President Donald Trump, who said the U.S. was "learning much from the failed missile explosion" and claimed that America has similar, but more advanced, technology.

"It would certainly would be quite strange if a country -- a world superpower that spends more money on defense than all the rest of the countries of the world -- was not involved in such projects," Peskov said, when asked to respond to Trump's statement. "That is why is this is not new information."

Rosatom, Russia's state atomic energy company, confirmed that five of its nuclear specialists were killed in the incident. The total casualty count is still unclear.

Local authorities reported a brief spike in radiation following the incident, while Russia's Defense Ministry said radiation levels were normal.

Asked to comment on the conflicting reports and concerns about the consequences for the local population, Peskov said: "I have nothing to add beyond what I stated. ... I can just assure you that in such a situation all the competent agencies do everything to assure the safety of the citizens of the Russian Federation is fully provided."

According to the official account, the elite scientists killed in the accident -- Alexey Vyushin, Yevgeny Koratayev, Vyacheslav Lipshev, Sergey Pichugin and Vladislav Yanovsky -- were killed during tests on a liquid propulsion system involving isotopes.

Sarov, known during the Cold War as Arzamas-16, is one of Russia's secret cities. Closed to foreigners and accessible only by special permit, Sarov is the rough equivalent to Los Alamos, New Mexico, one of the birthplaces of US nuclear weapons design.

In other words, the test most likely had some nuclear dimension. And the reflexive secrecy of the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin has only further fueled speculation about the cause of the accident.

Here's what we know: authorities in northern Russia detected a brief rise in radiation levels following an explosion at a military training ground there, Russian state news agency TASS reported Thursday.

Severodvinsk has a naval base and shipyard and TASS, citing emergency services, initially said the incident began onboard a ship.

The Arkhangelsk regional governor told TASS that the area around the explosion would not be evacuated. But the reports of the brief radiation spike and the lack of information around the incident raised immediate red flags.

'An unusual component'

While the Russian Ministry of Defense admitted something went wrong, informed observers immediately raised questions about what, exactly, had been going on at the test range.

Jeffrey Lewis, an arms-control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, was one of the first to suggest that missile accident had an unusual component.

On Twitter, Lewis linked to an August 8 picture captured by satellite imaging company Planet Labs, showing the Serebryanka, a nuclear fuel carrier, near the missile test site in Russia where the explosion and fire broke out.

The ship's presence, he speculated, might have been related to the testing of a nuclear-powered cruise missile.

The Serebrynka, Lewis noted, was the same ship used to recover a nuclear propulsion unit from a failed nuclear-powered cruise missile test last summer off Novaya Zemlya, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean.

"We are skeptical of the claim that what was being tested was a liquid propellant jet engine," Lewis told CNN, referring to last week's explosion. "We think it was a nuclear-powered cruise missile that they call Burevestnik." The same missile is known by NATO members as SCC-X-Skyfall.

A US official has also told CNN that the explosion was "likely" linked to the Skyfall prototype. US President Donald Trump also made the connection, tweeting on Monday: "The Russian 'Skyfall' explosion has people worried about the air and around the facility, and far beyond. Not good!"

Little public information is available about the Burevestnik/Skyfall. But last year, Putin boasted of new weaponry that he claimed would render US missile defenses obsolete. Showing a video, he said: "As the range is unlimited, the missile can maneuver for as long as necessary."

Questions linger today about whether something dangerous has been released following this incident. According to the local website 29.ru, officials have shut down the Dvina Bay in the White Sea for swimming for a month.

Is it the new Chernobyl? Certainly, no massive plume of radiation has been detected, as happened over Scandinavia before the Soviets acknowledged the 1986 disaster. But official secrecy often fuels fears of a cover-up.

In this case, the accident seems more reminiscent of an incident that happened 19 years ago: the sinking of the nuclear-powered submarine, the Kursk, led to the deaths of more than 100 sailors and was a public-relations disaster for Putin, who was still newly in office.

Today, unlike then, Putin now enjoys a near-total monopoly on Russian media. And the Kremlin thus far is working to contain and control the embarrassing news about the accident at a secret military test range.

Telfair was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in April after officers found a gun in his car during a 2017 traffic stop.

The 33-year-old former point guard who once played for teams including the Boston Celtics, Portland Trail Blazers, and Minnesota Timberwolves was pulled over in Brooklyn on June 11, 2017 after parking on a center median, making a U-turn off the median and driving without headlights, the district attorney's office said in a news release, citing trial testimony.

The officers who pulled Telfair over reported smelling the odor of marijuana and observed a lit marijuana cigarette in the car's console, the release from the district attorney's office said.

After Telfair and a male passenger were arrested, officers searched the vehicle and recovered a loaded .45 caliber gun in the console, the district attorney's office said.

The couple bought the home for $1,355,657. They spent about $100,000 on renovations, court documents show. They even attempted to get permission from the city's planning board to raze the house and divide the property into two lots. However, they were denied and put the house on the market.

They sold it in early July for approximately $959,000, according to Zillow, an online real estate database.

The Watcher wrote three letters to the Broaddus family shortly after they moved in, identifying details such as the family's car, the contractors whom they brought in to renovate and even the couple's three children.

"657 Boulevard is anxious for you to move in," one of the letters read, according to New York magazine. "It has been years and years since the young blood ruled the hallways of the house. Have you found all of the secrets it holds yet? Will the young blood play in the basement? Or are they too afraid to go down there alone. I would [be] very afraid if I were them. It is far away from the rest of the house. If you were upstairs you would never hear them scream.

"Will they sleep in the attic? Or will you all sleep on the second floor? Who has the bedrooms facing the street? I'll know as soon as you move in. It will help me to know who is in which bedroom. Then I can plan better."

In 2015, the couple tried to sue the previous tenants, John and Andrea Woods, over claims of fraudulent concealment, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress and several other issues related to the sale of the property. The case was dismissed.

The Woodses lived in the house for 23 years without incident. But a few days before they moved out, they received a letter from "The Watcher." However, the Woodses claim that the letter was not threatening and that they discarded it.

The Woodses would not comment on the case or the home, according to their attorney, Richard Kaplow.

A neighbor at 633 Boulevard also reported receiving a letter signed by the Watcher in the same time frame that the Broaddus family received their letters, Derek Broaddus testified in the trial against the Woodses. No other details about that letter were released.

A neighbor identified a man living next door to him as a possible suspect. The Broaddus family hired a private investigator and an ex-FBI profiler to try to find the identity of the Watcher. Derek Broaddus testified that the profiler concluded that it was "someone in their 50s or 60s" and lived nearby; the private investigator staked out the area and believed that the neighbors didn't "seem normal."

The Westfield Police and the Union County prosecutor's office investigated, but no one was arrested. No suspects have been publicly identified.

Neither Westfield Police officer Leonard Lugo, who investigated the case for the Broaddus family, nor the family's attorney responded to a request for comment, and the new owners have not been identified.

According to Deadline, Netflix won a featured rights deal for the story.

Malik's accusation referenced an incident from late February, when India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers, teetered on the brink of war following the Indian bombing of a Pakistani village. "Jai Hind #IndianArmedForces" (Hail India and its Armed Forces), Chopra had tweeted then.

The confrontation happened in the most unlikely place: the BeautyCon summit held in Los Angeles.

But, significantly, the exchange between an Indian actress and a Pakistani questioner also happened at a time when India and Pakistan seem to be once again at the brink of war.

On August 5, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, which has long wanted to make India a Hindu nation, announced the sudden abrogation of Article 370 and 35A of the Indian Constitution. These provisions (put in place when India and Pakistan were partitioned in 1947) had long granted autonomy to the disputed regions of Jammu and Kashmir, which straddle the border between the two countries. With their repeal, the restive region is now directly under the thumb of the BJP, which has also recently grabbed for itself the unilateral power to declare any individual a "terrorist" without any sort of due process.

"War is not something I am really fond of, but I am patriotic," Chopra went on to say to Malik.

But there should be a line drawn between being patriotic and showing sympathy for the Kashmir predicament. Chopra, between her tweet, the condescending way she began her response to Malik, and the fact that she even welcomed Modi to her wedding to Nick Jonas, shows that she has no sympathy for suffering Kashmiris.

This emerging interpretation of "patriotism" as a justified turning away from the plight of suffering Kashmiris, or Muslims or anyone whom Modi doesn't like is emblematic of what political scientist Kapil Komireddi calls the "cult of Modi."

In Bollywood, this "cult of Modi," with its fervent Hindu zealotry, has set itself to the task of producing films that support the BJP agenda, serving almost as an unofficial propaganda arm of the ruling party. Unsurprisingly, then, even as thousands of troops were marching into Jammu and Kashmir and eight million Kashmiris were aghast at being isolated and silenced, Bollywood film producers had already registered Kashmir-related film titles that they wanted to get under production. These include: "Kashmir is Ours", "The Tricolor (Indian flag) in Kashmir" and "Article 370." In the words of the producer of the Modi biopic who has also registered some of them, "I wanted to explore why one state was granted such privileges. But after the historic redrawing of our map by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I have just found the perfect ending for my film. From a film based on history, it is now going to be a historic film."

Since the constitutional abrogation on August 5, the eight million residents of Kashmir have been isolated from the world, with, according to the New York Times, nearly all communications to the outside world, from internet to cell phones and land lines, completely cut off. Curfews keep one and all indoors most of the day. Reports from the few journalists that have been permitted access "found a population that felt besieged, confused, frightened and furious at the seismic events of the week," according to the New York Times. Inhabitants have to beg one or another of the nearly 40,000 soldiers deployed to the region for permission to purchase necessities like milk; baby food is said to be running out in the Valley, and at every break in the curfew hundreds line up for a chance to use one of the landlines that the soldiers have permitted to remain connected.

There is one man who could halt the drumbeat of war in South Asia and he is neither Indian nor Pakistani but American. On July 22, 2019, American President Donald J. Trump played host to Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. At the press conference that followed the meeting, the Pakistani Prime Minister noted that "only the most powerful state in the world, headed by President Donald Trump" could bring the countries together. For his part, Trump agreed, adding that Prime Minister Modi had also made a similar request. "I think they'd like to see it resolved and I think you'd like to see it resolved," Trump said in July. "If I could help, I would love to be a mediator." According to the Indian Government, Modi did not make the request, a fact they emphasized precisely because Trump's intervention would bring India's power-grab more squarely in the international spotlight.

It is precisely for this last reason that President Trump should act on his offer to mediate.

As the Indian reaction to his offer, and even Priyanka Chopra's dismissive condescension toward the questioning of her own and India's position, demonstrates a callous lack of empathy by a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Ironically it also seems to imply that this goodwill ambassador (like the Indian Government) would prefer that the international community continues to ignore the situation. Too deeply immersed in the cult of Modi, many Indians are not interested in saving Kashmiris, and so others must keep their commitments and step up to the plate.Ken Cuccinelli tweaked the famous poem from Emma Lazarus -- whose words, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free" are long associated with immigration to the US and the nation's history as a haven -- as part of a case for strict new measures pushed Monday by the Trump administration that could dramatically change the legal immigration system.

"Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty, 'Give me your tired, give me your poor,' are also a part of the American ethos?" NPR's Rachel Martin asked Cuccinelli on "Morning Edition" in an interview published Tuesday.

"They certainly are: 'Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge,'" he replied. "That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge was passed -- very interesting timing."

On Monday, the Trump administration announced a regulation that makes it easier to reject green card and visa applications. The new rule means many green card and visa applicants could be turned down if they have low incomes or little education, and have used benefits such as most forms of Medicaid, food stamps, and housing vouchers, because they'd be deemed more likely to need government assistance in the future.

Cuccinelli has defended the changes, writing in a CNN op-ed published Tuesday that "self-sufficiency has been a core tenet of the American dream."

"Long-standing federal law has required foreign nationals to rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, sponsors and private organizations in their communities to succeed," Cuccinelli wrote.

Cuccinelli was asked about Lazarus' poem on Monday and whether the new immigration changes would merit its removal from the statue's pedestal.

"I do not think, by any means, we're ready to take anything off the Statue of Liberty," he said.

"We have a long history of being one of the most welcoming nations in the world on a lot of bases, whether you be an asylee, whether you be coming here to join your family or immigrating yourself," he said at the White House, adding that the regulation "will include a meaningful analysis of whether they're likely to become a public charge or not."

Strict immigration policies

The Trump administration has taken the toughest stance against legal and illegal immigration of any presidency in modern times.

Under Donald Trump's presidency, the US has fought to curtail the basis on which migrants can claim asylum, publicized large-scale raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an effort to deter would-be undocumented immigrants and backed a Republican Senate effort to create a skills-based immigration system.

Asked two years ago about the proposed skills-based changes -- which ultimately weren't passed -- White House senior adviser Stephen Miller shrugged off a question from CNN's Jim Acosta about whether the Trump administration's efforts amounted to an effort to "change what it means to be an immigrant coming into this country."

Miller responded that as a requirement to be naturalized, "you have to speak English," and continued, "so the notion that speaking English wouldn't be a part of immigration systems would be very ahistorical."

He went on: "Secondly, I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American liberty lighting the world. The poem that you're referring to was added later (and) is not actually part of the original Statue of Liberty."

Lazarus originally wrote the sonnet, entitled "The New Colossus," to raise funds for the statue's pedestal in 1883. The sculpture itself, which sits in the New York Harbor and was visible on the path to the immigration checkpoint at Ellis Island, was a gift from France to the US.

It was not until 1903 that Lazarus's words were inscribed on a bronze plaque and added to the site 17 years after the statue's original unveiling in 1886.

Some of you have supported the administration because you thought its cruel policies didn't affect "us" -- only people that some of us probably didn't care about or may have actively disliked: Mexicans, jihadists, undocumented workers and others. You didn't care about the Muslim ban. You didn't care when hundreds of Central American and Mexican children were separated at the border. Heck, you didn't even care when a 6-year-old Indian girl died at the southern border.

But Monday morning's news of the administration's new ruling lays bare its full cruelty and will affect millions of legal immigrants (including thousands of Indians) who will be punished for making use of public assistance programs, such as public housing and food stamps (no matter how temporarily) they are legally entitled to.

I've been saying, relatively quietly, for three years now, that Trump's goal -- and that of advisers like Stephen Miller -- is a nation with zero new immigration of brown and black people (they're hoping thousands of Norwegians will happily move here instead!) and hurting the folks already here.

Many of you likely supported Trump for reasons I've heard from people I know very well: the generous tax cuts for the wealthy and/or the tough talk on terrorism (Indians tend to not care as much about abortion or guns or the Supreme Court). He said we were "very, very special people." He appears to have hired more Indian-Americans in prominent roles than any other minority (hello, Ajit Pai, Nikki Haley, Seema Verma, Raj Shah, Neil Chatterjee and many more).

But you don't get to pick and choose which parts of the Trump era you like, as if it's some kind of buffet. As my wise mom says, you're responsible for everything on your plate. As many folks have pointed out, saying "I'm here for the tax cuts, but not the racism," isn't an option any longer.

If you continue to blindly support the administration after today, you are complicit in NEW problems about to hit millions in this country.

I know some of you are probably thinking that it's OK for the government to deny green cards to poor people who came here legally. That's because of a certain kind of educated brown privilege we don't recognize or talk about (so many of us arrived here with some of the best degrees in the world, including from the Indian Institute of Technology, Indian Institute of Management and, in my case, from St. Stephen's College, Delhi).

It's the same reason so many Indians love talking endlessly about the stats that purport to show Indian-Americans as the richest and most successful ethnic group in this country. But folks like Sudha Acharya of the South Asian Council for Social Services can tell you about the number of Indian Americans struggling in NYC alone, using the food pantry and other services SACSS provides. And I can tell you about the time I met my first Indian-American homeless man. Many of you who have been to parties in our home over the years have met him, too: Ravi is a waiter who lives in a homeless shelter and works multiple jobs to get back on his feet (he also doesn't shy away from talking about his situation, mainly so people know there are Indians like him, too).

Thanks for reading this far. I know I may lose some friends by writing this. Some relatives may stop talking to me and I'll likely get hate mail from some of the Indians who seem to spend their days being outraged online, but I just had to share my thoughts. Unquestioning support of any leader anywhere in the world diminishes us all.

I leave you with the story of Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Democratic Congressman from the Chicago area. He talks often and eloquently about how he came to this country as a child and how his family lived in public housing and, yes, used food stamps. He went on to have a successful business career and is now in the halls of Congress. If this new rule were in place when he was little, his family would never have gotten green cards.

Think about all the good that has come from the Congressman's life, all the positive contributions he and his family have made to this country. If the rules change as the President wants, opportunities will be lost for so many people.

I want to live in an America that gives us more Raja Krishnamoorthis, not fewer. And not just because he's Indian.

His wife, Juana, and children are desperate to find him.

Juana says she hasn't slept since her husband was detained.

Gomez-Jorge was working at the Morton Koch Foods plant Wednesday when the raids occurred and has not been in contact with his family since.

Juana invited CNN into the family's home Monday to discuss how the raids have affected their family.

"We don't know where he is," she said. "We don't know if he's dead or alive."

The couple has four children, ages 11, 9, 6 and a toddler, Juana says. In a video that has now gone viral, Juana's oldest child, Magdalena, was seen crying after her father was detained.

Juana says her daughter loves her father and, like all of her children, is sad that he is gone. "Her father is very important to her. Her heart was moved," she said of her daughter.

"My children are sad. They are worried," the mother said. "I don't know where he is."

Juana says she doesn't work and depends on her husband to bring in all their income. She says she doesn't have any family in the area.

She is afraid she won't be able to afford rent, utilities or whatever bail she may need to get her husband out of detention. She thinks it could be as much as $6,000 and doesn't know how or where she would get that much money.

"I feel very powerless. I don't have a job, only my husband works. I'm thinking, what am I going to do?" she asked.

Juana says she and her husband have lived in the United States for more than a decade and came here for better opportunities.

"He didn't come here to rob anybody," Juana explained. "He came here to work. It is out of necessity."

Juana tells CNN that if her husband is deported she will have no choice but to return to Guatemala with her children in tow. The kids were all born in the United States. They have never been to Guatemala and have told her they don't want to go, she said.

The fact that her 11-year-old daughter Magdalena's tearful pleas went viral has not escaped her.

Juana says she is frightened because the entire world has seen her daughter's face.

She says the family has had interactions with people that have scared them since the video was taken. Juana says that the family has received strange calls with some people even inquiring about adopting Magdalena.

The video has been shared so widely that even US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) responded.

"I understand that the girl is upset, and I get that. But her father committed a crime," Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of CBP told CNN's Jake Tapper on State of the Union on Sunday.

ICE spokesman Bryan Cox told CNN Monday that Gomez-Jorge does not have any prior criminal convictions. The father of four was arrested while "working without legal authorization," Cox said.

Cox said that although Gomez-Jorge has not been convicted of a crime, the US Attorney Southern District of Mississippi will decide whether he or any of the people detained last week will be deported.

All Gomez-Jorge's family can do now is search for him and wait for his release.

Magdalena seems uncomfortable with the fame she's garnered. She was very quiet when CNN visited. She worked on her homework and played with her younger siblings after school, sharing soda and candy.

The 11-year-old said her favorite subject is math, so much so that she wants to be a math teacher when she grows up.

But right now, she just wants her dad to come home. Magdalena says a lot of her friends had parents who were detained in the raids and a large number of them, like her, still have a parent in detention.

Her teachers didn't address the raid when she returned to school the day it occurred, she says.

Juana says she will continue to search for her husband and is looking for a lawyer to help the family. She's being strong for her kids, telling her daughter not to cry and that they will find a way to pay bond so Gomez-Jorge can come home.

"For my children, I want to find him," she said. "It's like there has been a death."

The long-anticipated public charge rule makes it more difficult for immigrants who rely on government assistance like Medicaid, subsidized housing and food stamps to obtain legal status.

Monday's announcement falls in line with the administration's attempts to curb legal immigration, and favor wealthier and more educated immigrants.

Here's what to know:

Who does the rule apply to?

The rule applies to people who are seeking to come to or trying to remain in the United States. Notably, it'll affect people who are trying to obtain lawful permanent status, otherwise known as a green card.

What is public charge?

The "public charge" provision dates back at least to the Immigration Act of 1882. Federal lawmakers at the time wanted to make sure that immigrants would be able to take care of themselves and not end up a public burden.

Under current regulations put in place in 1996, the term is defined as someone who is "primarily dependent" on government assistance, meaning it supplies more than half their income.

But it only counted cash benefits, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or Supplemental Security Income from Social Security. The administration's new rule widens the definition of who is expected to be dependent on the government by including more benefit programs.

Immigration officials can take into account an applicant's financial resources, health, education, skills, family status and age. But few people are rejected on these relatively narrow grounds, experts said.

"It's totally changing the conception of what it means to be a public charge," said David Bier, immigration policy analyst at the libertarian CATO Institute.

Which programs are included?

The rule will effect people who receive most forms of Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers.

It doesn't include benefits such as emergency medical assistance, disaster relief, national school lunch programs, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and food pantries and homeless shelters.

The rule includes immigrants who use one or more designated public benefits for 12 months within a 36-month period. Each benefit is counted separately, meaning if two benefits are used in a month, it'll count as two months.

How many people does this impact?

It's hard to know exactly how many people will be affected because it's largely subject to the discretion of the officer who will take into account whether someone is likely to become a public charge.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, however, the rule is expected to impact roughly 382,000 people seeking to adjust their immigration status. Immigration advocates, however, say millions of people could be affected by the regulation.

Immigration advocates have also argued that the rule goes beyond what Congress intended and would discriminate against those from poorer countries, keep families apart and prompt legal residents to forgo needed public aid, which could also impact their US citizen children.

"The rule reflects a dark vision of the United States -- as an unwelcoming nation that wants to keep out people who seek to join their family, work hard, and climb the economic ladder -- based on the erroneous assumption that they won't contribute to our communities, our economy, and our nation," said Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

What about undocumented immigrants?

Undocumented immigrants are largely ineligible for public assistance so they generally would not be affected, unless an avenue opens up for them to apply for green cards or visas.

What about US citizen children?

The regulation doesn't apply to benefits used by US citizen children, according to a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official.

Are there exceptions?

There are exceptions to the rule, such as benefits received by active duty member of the military and their spouses and children; Medicaid for pregnant women and people under 21 years old; and emergency medical care.

The rule also doesn't impact refugees or asylum seekers, as well as certain trafficking victims, victims of domestic violence, among others.

Do immigrants use public benefits?

The CATO Institute released a study last year reviewing the use rates of some benefit programs by immigrants and native-born Americans. The group found that "immigrants are less likely to consume welfare benefits and, when they do, they generally consume a lower dollar value of benefits than native-born Americans."

When will this take effect?

The rule will take effect October 15. Until then, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is "continuing to work towards finalizing the processes and procedures that will be required to implement the final public charge rule," according to a USCIS official.

The rule will only apply to applications and petition on or after the effective date, according to the agency.

Over the next year, the beverage company plans to unveil new Dasani packaging and products, including aluminum cans and bottles, "How2Recycle" labels and improved Dasani water coolers.

Coca-Cola will continue to sell Dasani in plastic bottles too, but it will reduce the amount of plastic in those containers through a process called lightweighting. Coke is also launching a new hybrid bottle made with up to 50% recycled plastic and renewable, plant-based materials.

As consumers grow concerned about plastic pollution, big companies are pledging to reduce packaging waste. Coca-Cola produced 3.3 million tons of plastic in 2017, it disclosed in a recent report by the Ellen MacArthur foundation. And environmental activists have called out the company for contributing to the problem. A recent report published by Greenpeace called Coca-Cola "the most prolific polluter" compared to other top brands because in a series of global beach cleanups, Coca-Cola branded packages were collected the most.

"We believe that all packaging materials have benefits, and, if managed properly, can be turned into valuable resources for reuse," Coca-Cola said in response to the report. "We're prepared to do our part."

Environmental commitments may help protect the company's image.

Coca-Cola has promised to collect and recycle the equivalent of every bottle or can it sells by 2030. It's also committed to making its bottles and cans out of at least 50% recycled material in the next 11 years. And recently, Coca-Cola said it has withdrawn from the Plastics Industry Association because the lobbying group took positions that "were not fully consistent with our commitments and goals."

The changes to Dasani could help Coca-Cola reach those goals and remove about 1 billion virgin plastic bottles, made with non-recycled plastic, from its supply chain over the next five years.

It'll have some competition.

PepsiCo has also announced that it will start selling its Aquafina water brand in aluminum cans at US fast food and restaurant chains as soon as next year. The company is also testing out a broader rollout to retail stores.

Greening Dasani

Using aluminum bottles and cans may help increase the number of of Dasani products that get recycled. Aluminum is recycled more easily than plastic, and the "How2Recycle" labels should help clarify how the package should be recycled.

The company is also launching a new version of the Dasani PureFill water dispensers, which allow people fill their own bottles or cups with Dasani products, including flavored and sparkling waters.

Environmentalists argue the best way to eliminate waste is to reuse containers. But the "solution can't be one thing," said Bruce Karas, vice president of environment and sustainability for Coca-Cola North America.

Coca-Cola's plan is to "create a future where the consumer has a number of choices" that can reduce their impact on the environment, he said. Launching several types of products will help Coca-Cola learn about consumer behavior, he added.

Making Dasani special

Innovations could not only help Coca-Cola reach its goals, but revitalize interest in Dasani.

"We really think about the future of this brand differentiating on sustainability credentials," said Lauren King, brand director for Dasani, who noted that Dasani is growing along with the bottled water trend.

Sales of packaged water have been growing steadily over the past several years, according to a report published by the research brand Mintel in February. The sector will probably continue to grow, Mintel said, because consumers are ditching sugary drinks for healthier options like water and seltzer.

But sales could take a hit if customers decide to fill up their own bottles from the tap instead of buying water in plastic bottles to help protect the environment.

Dasani also faces increased competition from store-brand water brands, which consumers often buy in bulk.

"Mainstream water brands like Dasani were under pressure," Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said during an analyst call discussing the company's second quarter earnings. "There's some challenge there," he said.

But Coca-Cola's premium water brand, Smartwater, is doing "really well," he said. That may be because it offers certain ingredients people wouldn't find in plain tap water, including added electrolytes or antioxidants.

Apple on Monday released the first look at the series, which is set to debut this fall.

No actual footage of the stars in action is shown in the minute-long sneak peek, but moody shots of hallways set the tone for the preview.

The overlapping voices of Witherspoon, Carell and Aniston are also heard in a cacophony of dramatic moments.

"I'm a journalist, I can feel when the world needs me," Carell can be heard saying at one point.

"People want to trust that the person telling them the news of the world is an honest person," Witherspoon's character says at another.

"The Morning Show" was one of several shows Apple highlighted earlier this year at an event previewing the content coming to the forthcoming streaming service. (CNN's Brian Stelter is a consultant on the project, for which his book was used as background.)

The show, Witherspoon said at the event, pulls back "the curtain on "the power dynamics between men and women in the high-stakes world of morning news shows."

"It's a real insiders view into the lives of the people who help America wake up every day," she added.

The "Hunger Games" star put up a photo of what appears to be beautiful sunset scene on a beach. It appeared on his official Instagram account early Tuesday.

The caption jumped right into the ending of his marriage of less than a year to the singer/actress.

"Hi all," Hemsworth wrote, "Just a quick note to say that Miley and I have recently separated and I wish her nothing but health and happiness going forward."

Over the weekend People magazine reported that the couple, who married in December 2018 after an almost decadelong, on-again, off-again relationship, had broken up.

"Liam and Miley have agreed to separate at this time," a rep for Cyrus told the publication in a statement. "Ever-evolving, changing as partners and individuals, they have decided this is what's best while they both focus on themselves and careers. They still remain dedicated parents to all of their animals they share while lovingly taking this time apart. Please respect their process and privacy."

CNN has reached out to representatives for the couple.

In his Instagram caption, Hemsworth, 29, also appeared to address a Daily Mail Australia story which had been picked up by other outlets quoting him as saying about the split, "You don't understand what it's like."

"This is a private matter and I have not made, nor will I be making, any comments to any journalists or media outlets," Hemsworth wrote. "Any reported quotes attributed to me are false. Peace and Love."

The U.S. Trade Representative announced a delay in new tariffs on several categories of Chinese-made consumer goods until December 15. Those goods include cell phones, laptop computers, video game consoles, certain toys, computer monitors, and certain items of footwear and clothing.

The Dow was up more than 500 points, or 2%, in mid-morning trading following Monday's nearly 400-point drop. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rose more than 2% as well.

Tech stocks were among the market's biggest winners. Apple surged 5% while chipmakers Nvidia and Intel were up more than 3%.

Sneaker giant Nike rose 3% as well while toy makers Hasbro and Mattel soared 6% and 8% respectively. Best Buy soared more than 7%.

The news was announced shortly after China's Ministry of Commerce said that vice premier Liu Heying spoke with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about trade issues and will talk again in two weeks.

The apparent ceasefire in the trade war delighted investors and overshadowed earlier concerns that a spike in a key measure of inflation reported Tuesday morning could complicate matters for the Federal Reserve.

The Fed recently cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 and is expected to lower rates further due to a sluggish global economy that's hurting as a result of the US-China trade war and weak demand in the UK and Europe.

The so-called core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy costs, rose more than forecast in July for the second straight month and has now increased 2.2% over the past year. That's the biggest increase in six months.

The Fed typically raises rates when inflation is creeping higher, but the central bank has been criticized by President Trump for possibly hiking rates too aggressively in the past few years and being too slow to cut rates in 2019.

The return of market volatility in recent weeks is unnerving investors, especially those looking to save for retirement. That's especially the case since stocks have been the only game in town for conservative investors.

Bond yields have continued to plunge. The benchmark US-10 Year Treasury is now hovering around 1.68%, not far from its lowest level in about three years, while the 30-Year Treasury is approaching an all-time low near 2.1%.

Yields in the U.K. are near zero as well while long-term rates in Japan and much of Europe are now in negative territory.

The 35-year-old was a seven-year veteran who temporarily was assigned to a detail surrounding Yankee Stadium.

The officer left a note behind, the law enforcement official said. He was off-duty at the time, two law enforcement sources told CNN.

Of the eight NYPD officer suicides, six have happened since June. The recent cluster has rattled the department, with leaders trying to come up with a way to tell the rank and file that it's OK to ask for help.

Over the past five years, the NYPD has averaged between four and five suicides a year, Police Commissioner James O'Neill said in June at a news conference that was called after the department surpassed its average.

Developing story. More to come.

Newark is taking the advice of the US Environmental Protection Agency and providing bottled water from four city centers, Mayor Ras Baraka and Gov. Phil Murphy said in a joint statement.

The city "has gradually gone from absolutely denying there are any lead problems to now admitting they have an issue," said Erik D. Olson, a drinking water expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group that has taken legal action against the city.

No safe level of lead

There is no safe level of lead in drinking water, experts say. Because even low levels have been linked to serious, irreversible damage to developing brains, children and pregnant women are most vulnerable. In healthy adults, exposure to lead is associated with fertility issues, heart and kidney problems, mental dysfunction and high blood pressure.

The City of Newark exceeds every other large New Jersey municipality in the number of children younger than 6 with elevated blood lead levels, according to a recent New Jersey Department of Health report. Newark's lead levels are also among the highest in the nation -- "approximately the same" as those measured by independent testing in Flint, Michigan, before corrective measures were taken, according to a Natural Resources Defense Council report.

In 2015, at least 10% of tested addresses in Newark showed 27 parts per billion or more of lead in their water, according to the council. This is nearly twice the EPA's guideline of 15 parts per billion. More recently -- since January 1, 2018 -- at least six samples exceeded 30 parts per billion, and one residence sample showed levels as high as 182 parts per billion, according to a court document filed by the council.

Where is the problem? Not at the source but in the pipes, the city says.

A Garden State problem

Newark says its complex water system supplies about 80 million gallons per day of water to more than 300,000 customers within the city and its surrounding communities.

The city uses two sources for water. The Pequannock Water Treatment Plant, in West Milford, supplies the North, West, South and Central Wards, while the Wanaque Water Treatment Plant mainly supplies the East Ward.

Water leaving both these treatment plants is lead-free, the city says, and the pipes that transport it, which are mostly made of iron and steel, do not add the heavy metal.

It is only when the water travels through service pipes connecting water mains in the street to individual homes that lead can enter, a city website explains. (Lead may also enter drinking water from the plumbing in individual homes.)

Olson said the Natural Resources Defense Council learned in 2017 that Newark had elevated lead levels. But when the advocacy group approached city officials to offer help, "we didn't get anywhere." In 2018, the nonprofit teamed up with the Newark Education Workers Caucus and began litigation against the city, which is ongoing.

The complaint alleges that the City of Newark failed to install and maintain the corrosion control treatment necessary to prevent water corrosion on service lines and lead plumbing, allowing lead to leach into drinking water.

A September 17 motion to dismiss the complaint, submitted by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, states that Newark is in compliance "with the process required for water systems that are no longer deemed to have optimized corrosion control."

Quick-fix fails

The long-term solution to Newark's problem is pulling out the lead service lines, according to both the city and Olson. As a short-term fix, the Newark Department of Water and Sewer Utilities distributed more than 35,000 lead-safe water filters and cartridges to affected residents for free this year.

However, the EPA said in a Friday letter to Baraka and Catherine McCabe, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, that lead levels exceeded 15 parts per billion (the federal water standard) in several samples taken since the filters were distributed.

"Use of the specific filtration devices distributed by Newark may not be reliably effective, in this particular situation, in reducing lead concentrations to below that standard," the letter says.

Olson said the filters are complex, with installation and maintenance instructions printed in small type, and so door-to-door training may be necessary. Until the filter program is fixed, he said, bottled water is needed.

The EPA recommended the same in its letter, which was meant to "address concerns" and inspire enforcement of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Meanwhile, the agency is "actively providing technical assistance to the city and state, including work to optimize and assess the city's corrosion control program," the EPA said in a statement obtained by CNN.

Newark's mayor has not responded to a request for comment.

No word on if she was actually tipsy at a party in Los Angeles on Saturday night, but clips of the singer dancing and lip-syncing her own music have spawned a #DrunkTaylor hashtag on social media.

"Threw a party to celebrate with the people who made the ME! & YNTCD videos with me- and we had so much fun that 'Drunk Taylor' is trending on Twitter. CHEERS," Swift wrote on Instagram.

She had gathered with friends to celebrate her 10 VMA nominations. Guests at the party included Laverne Cox, Hayley Kiyoko, the Haim sisters and A'keria Davenport.

Swift's new album, "Lover," is set to be released August 23.

Swift took home the inaugural Icon Award during the show, which aired on Fox.

She used her acceptance speech to support the US Women's National soccer team's fight against the gender pay gap.

The team's co-captain, Alex Morgan, presented the superstar singer with the award.

The players have become visible advocates about the need for pay equality among the sexes -- given that they're not paid the same as their male counterparts.

"Get online, talk about it, let people know how you feel about it because what happened to them is unfair," Swift said. "It's happening everywhere, and they are heroes and icons for standing up."

"Riverdale" took home four surfboard trophies, including Choice Drama TV Show, Drama Actor and Actress for stars Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart, and Choice Ship for the pair.

"Avengers: Endgame" was also was a big winner, scoring awards in the action film category for Choice Movie, Choice Actor for Robert Downey Jr., Choice Actress for Scarlett Johansson and Choice Villain for Josh Brolin.

Musical group The Jonas Brothers were awarded the Decade Award.

"Bachelor in Paradise" stars Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon officially tied the knot this weekend, according to People magazine. The lavish Rhode Island bash was packed with familiar "Bachelor" faces, and the ceremony was even officiated by "Bachelor" producer Elan Gale.

READ MORE: The business of the "Bachelor" franchise

The two lovebirds first met on the second season of "Bachelor in Paradise," where jilted contestants from "The Bachelor" and "The Bachelorette" meet and mingle and who knows, sometimes get married! The couple got engaged while filming Season 5 of the show in June of last year.

"Love works in mysterious ways," Haibon wrote in a post-engagement Instagram. Hey, "Bachelor" franchise, that's not a bad catchphrase!

Nguyen, known under his stage name Dango Nu Yen, appeared in several episodes of the third season of the Atlanta-based hit show about a zombie apocalypse.

He played a guard for the town of Woodbury who worked for The Governor, a villain who frequently fought with the show's protagonist Rick Grimes.

After his stint on the show ended, Nguyen appeared in other TV shows including "The Red Road" and "Banshee," according to his IMDB profile.

The actor served on the Athens-Clarke County Fire Department for nearly 20 years before leaving to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, the fire department said in a Facebook post.

He was a sergeant with the department before working as an actor, the post said.

Nguyen had also trained as a professional wrestler prior to becoming a firefighter, according to his IMDB page.

"He will always be remembered for his physical and mental strength," the Facebook post read. "He was an aggressive and tenacious firefighter and first responder."

Nguyen is survived by his wife, Michelle, and family, the Athens-Clarke County Fire department said.

Netflix has announced that is the date Season 3 of the "The Crown" will debut.

This time around there's a new queen as Academy Award winner Olivia Colman takes over the role from Claire Foy, who played Queen Elizabeth II the first two seasons.

Netflix shared a snippet of Colman in character in a tweet on Monday.

Colman looks every inch the royal as she is seen pacing in a room, dressed in an evening gown with a royal blue sash and a crown before she turns and stares piercingly at the camera.

The role is totally in the wheelhouse for the actress, who won the best actress Academy Award for her portrayal as England's Queen Anne in "The Favourite."

Colman may be able to continue that award streak with "The Crown."

Her predecessor, Foy, won a Primetime Emmy, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her portrayal of the current British monarch.

On Monday the singer/songwriter posted a black-and-white photo of herself in a bra and panty set on her official Instagram account.

Rexha shared a story in which she said she "recently had a MALE music executive tell me that I was getting too old and that my brand was 'confusing.'"

"Because... I'm a songwriter and I post sexy pics on my Instagram and that's not what female songwriters are suppose to do, especially for my age. I'm 29," the caption read. "I'm fed up with being put in a box."

She went on to say that she makes her own rules and added "I'm tired of women getting labeled as 'hags' when they get old and guys get labeled as sexy with age."

"Anyways, I'm turning 30 on August 30 and you know what, I'm not running away from it," Rexha wrote. "I'm not gonna lie about my age or sing songs that I feel will sell better because they sound 'younger.'"

Rexha is known for pushing back.

In January she used her Instagram account to say that unnamed fashion designers were declining to dress her for the Grammys as they said she was "too big."

"Empower women to love their bodies instead of making girls and women feel less then by their size," she wrote in the caption of a video of her discussing the issue. "We are beautiful any size!"

Autopsies confirmed the bodies found last Wednesday in northern Manitoba are those of Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

"The RCMP can also confirm that the two died in what appears to be suicides by gunfire. While both individuals were deceased for a number of days before they were found, the exact time and date of their deaths are not known," the law enforcement agency said in a statement. "However, there are strong indications that they had been alive for a few days since last seen in July and during the extensive search efforts in the Gillam area."

Authorities said next of kin have been notified and offered support.

Two firearms were found with the teens and forensic analysis is underway to confirm whether they are connected to the three British Columbia homicides, the RCMP said.

The search gripped the world for weeks after the suspects allegedly killed a North Carolina woman and her Australian boyfriend.

Chynna Deese, 24, and her boyfriend, Lucas Fowler, 23, were found shot dead on a remote highway in northern British Columbia on July 15.

As police searched for clues to the killers' whereabouts and panicked residents shuttered their homes, the body of University of British Columbia professor Leonard Dyck was discovered four days later in northern British Columbia, a few hundred miles away from the first crime scene.

A burned-out camper believed to have been used by the two suspects was found a mile from Dyck's body. Investigators believe the teens killed all three victims, and police scoured rugged terrain for clues to where they might be hiding.

By late July, authorities were investigating signs suggesting the teens were in northern Manitoba, at least a two-day drive east of the sites of the British Columbia killings. Police urged residents near Manitoba's Nelson River to remain inside, lock their doors and report anything suspicious.

An end to the search

But last Wednesday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it believed the suspects' bodies were found in northern Manitoba.

Authorities had been searching the area for weeks after a Toyota RAV4 that authorities believe the teens stole from Dyck was found on fire and discarded July 22 outside Gillam, a small Manitoba town situated along Nelson River and Stephens Lake.

The teens' bodies were found in "dense brush" about 5 miles from where the burned-out vehicle was located, said Jane MacLatchy, assistant commissioner of the Manitoba RCMP.

Discovery of a damaged boat and other clues

Though police already were searching areas near the burned RAV4, they said they narrowed the search even further on August 2 when they found items of interest near the Nelson River.

Police first said they found a damaged aluminum boat along the river that day. Later, they said they'd separately found "items directly linked to the suspects" that same day on the shoreline.

Police haven't said whether the boat is connected to the teens, and they haven't said what those other items were.

The teens' bodies were found within a kilometer from where the unspecified items were discovered, MacLatchy said.

The motive still is unclear

The investigation is not closed even though authorities believe the suspects were the killers, said Kevin Hackett, the RCMP assistant commissioner in British Columbia.

Investigators, for instance, still are trying to determine a motive -- and that will be difficult, Hackett said.

"The examination of the area where (their bodies) were located ... is still being dealt with and searched. So there may be additional items that could help in that regard -- identifying a motive, etc. -- but we don't have that information yet," he said.

But police say they are sure the killings are connected, and they have nothing to indicate anyone else was involved.

"There was significant evidence that linked our suspects to both crime scenes," Hackett said last week.

Mass shootings, like the murder of 22 people in El Paso on August 3, are not caused by video games. They are not simply caused by mental illness. And we should not be surprised that this kind of violence eventually found our community. In today's America, it was only a matter of time.

Racism and anti-immigrant hysteria have long shaped the tragic side of our American experience, but the spread of racism and violence now takes a new form that departs from our history.

When President Donald Trump describes Mexican immigrants as "rapists" and "bringing crime," or refers to undocumented immigrants as individuals who "infest our country" -- he speaks not as America's President but as an emissary of hate. And his vilification and fear-mongering connect with those who are open to receiving it.

The seeds of terror we saw that August day are transmitted day and night on Fox News, the most watched cable news channel in the country. They are amplified by right-wing websites like Breitbart, and in messages forced onto local news broadcasts by Sinclair Media.

They metastasize on Facebook. And they filter up from grotesque online havens for white supremacists who preach intolerance and worship violence.

At a rally in Florida this past May, Trump asked how America could stop immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees from coming into the country.

"Shoot them!" someone yelled back.

As the crowd roared its approval, the President smiled and brushed the comment aside.

Every media outlet that covers Trump's rallies uncritically is serving dangerous ends. This language of fear and intimidation is not, as some would have it, simply political theater; it actually changes our behavior. Counties that hosted a Trump rally in 2016 saw a 226% increase in hate crimes, according to an analysis by The Washington Post. And we've seen a rise in these kinds of crimes since Trump's been a candidate and in office.

Within 24 hours of Trump signing an executive order attempting to ban people from seven Muslim majority countries in January 2017, the mosque in Victoria, Texas, was burned to the ground. After he warned of waves of asylum seekers coming to get us -- and entertained the lie that George Soros, a wealthy Jew, was financing a migrant caravan -- a man walked into a Pittsburgh synagogue and murdered men and women over a fear of Jewish-financed caravans.

Right before a terrorist came to our community to kill 22 innocent people, police believe he wrote a manifesto that used the President's language of "invasion." The President used the word "invasion" to describe immigration in over 2,000 ads on Facebook. He also used the words "predator," "invasion," "alien," "killer," "criminal" and "animal" while discussing immigrants at his rallies more than 500 times.

As long as the President employs this rhetoric, and as long as it is tolerated or ignored by so many, tragedies like these will continue to tear our country apart.

We must call on Republicans in Congress to put country before party by holding Trump accountable. We must implore members of the press to stop musing about whether or not the President is racist. We must ensure that a democracy that has been captured and corrupted by the NRA can summon the courage to pass common sense measures like universal background checks, red flag laws and a ban on assault weapons -- proposals which the majority of Americans agree should be in place. As president, I would work with Congress to create a system of federal licensing requirements, which states would implement and have the ability to go beyond.

But none of this will happen until something much larger changes.

Wherever I travel, I always tell people about my love for El Paso. I tell them we are a diverse and safe city -- and that the two are very much connected. We've learned to not only tolerate our differences, but to embrace them as fundamental to our success and our security. El Paso's story is quintessentially an American story: We are a city of immigrants, situated proudly at the border of this nation of immigrants.

Recently, I was in New York where, over a century ago, America opened its gates to the teeming masses of the world at Ellis Island. Today, the Statue of Liberty beckons to the world from here in El Paso, at every port of entry, and shines light upon every bridge across the Rio Grande. When the President demonizes and stirs up hatred against immigrants, he is not only attacking my hometown -- he is attacking the very meaning of America.

I believe El Paso can light our path forward, even as America now stands in sympathy and solidarity in its hour of heartbreak and anger. But for good to prevail, we need to bring every single one of us in. That means refusing to let hate win or to quit on our fellow Americans.

In this great democracy, the power still rests with the people. And it is on all of us, individually and through the institutions of the press and Congress, to decide what this country will stand for at this defining moment of truth.

The plan comes on the heels of a new health care proposal for rural America he released last week. Buttigieg on Tuesday is also making his seventh trip to Iowa since declaring his candidacy, which will include a stop at the Iowa State Fair.

Rural voters, Buttigieg writes in the new plan, have been harmed under the Trump administration "in an unnecessary trade war that treats farmers like pawns and thinks they'll be satisfied with a subsidy rather than their life's work."

Buttigieg's plan for rural revitalization -- much like his previous plans for minority outreach, labor and rural health care -- is tied to his record as mayor. He has cited $850 million in investments into South Bend since he took office in 2012, but he's been criticized for his focus on the revitalization of downtown and has been accused of forgetting the city's low-income suburbs, which have struggled in recent years.

"Just as my own hometown rose up to start a new chapter and meet the future with a fresh approach and new ideas, we can tackle this moment of urgency head on to create opportunity for rural Americans if we empower our communities rather than overlook them," Buttigieg writes. "This plan unleashes the potential of small towns across America with good jobs, an opportunity to grow a business, and the infrastructure to raise a healthy and happy family."

Rural entrepreneurship

In an attempt to "revitalize America's rural economy and catalyze job creation," Buttigieg wants to provide $500 million in federal funding for "Regional Innovation Clusters," allowing state and local governments to take the lead on developing economic projects based on the specific needs of individual rural communities through a grant program judged by a panel of entrepreneurs across the country.

Buttigieg also pledges up to $5 billion to expand apprenticeship networks across the country in an attempt "to ensure an apprenticeship program in a growing industry is available within 30 miles of every American," including underserved rural areas. Similar to his rural health care plan to attract immigrant doctors, Buttigieg seeks to create "Community Renewal visas," with the aim of attracting high-skilled immigrants with the promise of attaining a green card at the end of a three-year residence in rural communities.

Buttigieg's plan would double funding for antitrust enforcement and lower the reporting threshold for mergers in an effort to improve oversight.

In addition, the plan reiterates his call for a $15 federal minimum hourly wage and paid family leave for rural workers.

Investing in technology

The plan also looks to deal with climate change. Rural communities, he writes, are the "frontlines of climate change," and can "become the engines of innovation for addressing climate change and economic growth" under a Buttigieg administration. He called for doubling the $2.5 billion in research and development funding from the US Department of Agriculture on providing solutions to climate change, with an additional $50 billion investment over the next 10 years in farming technology, food safety and natural resources. Buttigieg calls for increased incentives for conservation, paying farmers to maximize land conservation and biodiversity in rural areas while reducing bureaucratic barriers to accessing said programs.

The plan calls for technological investments in rural broadband expansion. In a nod to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's investment in the national highway program, which expanded rural transportation access to underserved rural areas, Buttigieg's plan calls for "Internet for All," pledging $80 billion in expanded internet services by the end of his first term in office.

Expanding education

In addition to expanding broadband access and increased funding for apprenticeship programs, Buttigieg's plan aims to reduce the teacher shortage in rural areas by 50% by increasing salaries and instituting student loan forgiveness for rural teachers. While many of his Democratic competitors have called for free college tuition, Buttigieg instead has instead pushed for subsidies for those Americans who are in need. The plan details free tuition for low and middle-income students, targeting rural areas "where students are more likely to be low-income and college is often more out of reach."

Increased grant funding for satellite hubs within community college networks will ao allow rural students to access college education where they live, as will increased funding for historically black colleges and universities, tribal colleges and minority-serving institutions.

"While some people are telling me, 'Gosh, this is a terrible time to leave the campaign. Can't you find a way out of it?' That's not what this is about," the Hawaii Democrat said in a news release. "I look forward to joining my fellow soldiers for a joint-training exercise with the Indonesian military, focused on counterterrorism and disaster response."

Gabbard, who has deployed to the Middle East twice in her time in the Army National Guard, heads to active-duty training during a crucial time in her campaign. Despite a breakout performance at the second round of Democratic primary debates last month, she has yet to qualify for the third round of debates in September.

"I love our country," Gabbard said Monday. "I am grateful to be able to serve our country and the American people in many ways, including as a soldier."

Outside of her military service, Gabbard's campaign has largely been marked by low poll numbers and controversy surrounding her past views on same-sex marriage and LGBTQ equality. Gabbard said early this year in a statement to CNN that she regrets the positions she took in the past on the issue and has worked toward passing legislation that ensures equal rights and protections.

A CNN poll released early last month found she holds just 1% support.

But her military experience has become a central selling point to her campaign. During the second night of July's debates -- wherein Gabbard finished the night as Google's most-searched candidate -- she wielded her credentials as an Iraq War veteran to speak about foreign policy decisions with a personal tone

"For too long, we had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence, the toll it takes on our service members, on their families," Gabbard said. "We have to do the right thing. End the wasteful regime change wars and bring our troops home.

"The leadership I will bring to do the right thing, to bring our troops home within the first year in office, because they shouldn't have been there this long."

"Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty, 'Give me your tired, give me your poor,' are also a part of the American ethos?" NPR's Rachel Martin asked Cuccinelli on "Morning Edition" in an interview published Tuesday.

"They certainly are: 'Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge,'" he replied, altering the entire point of the poem.

It actually reads: "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, Iift my lamp beside the golden door!"

Cuccinnelli, the nation's top immigration official and acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, also pointed out that the "public charge" law on which the Trump administration is basing new immigration policy was written the year before that poem.

He tried to offer a history lesson Monday to argue that legal immigrants from poor parts of the world aren't being targeted by the new rules disqualifying them from green cards if they seek public assistance.

"This is 140-year-old legal structure," he said. "We're dealing with the most recent iteration of it, but this is not new. This was -- the same question might have been asked when my Italian immigrants were coming, immigrant ancestors were coming in and all through that 140 years. So we're -- we're not doing anything new here, we're simply making effective what Congress had already put on the books. So there's no reason for any particular group to feel like this is targeting them. This will apply across the world."

What he was referring to is a law Congress passed many generations ago -- the Immigration Act of 1882. And as Cuccinelli said, the language of that law allowed immigration authorities at US ports to root out anyone they felt was a "convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge."

It was through that language that women and children not accompanied by a man, people suspected of being gay or lesbian, the deaf and others were barred entry. The law was expanded in the early 20th century to extend to anyone who, for a reason that existed before entering the U.S., became a "public charge" within five years.

But these cases accounted for a very small percentage of immigrants more than 100 years ago.

"The United States has a long history of limiting or outright excluding people based on what the government deemed undesirable," said Michael Innis-Jiménez, an professor of American studies at the University of Alabama. "This undesirability was based on race, nationality or any number of reasons the government classified as a 'defect.' These were the people who could not enter the United States legally."

The laws, which have their roots in rules set up during the Colonial era, long predate the federally funded social safety net of public assistance to help the elderly and the poor that Trump is now closing off to prospective immigrants.

The Trump administration has different immigration values than previous administrations. It's undertaken an aggressive effort to cut down on legal as well as illegal immigration. It's ended long-standing refugee programs called Temporary Protected Status for some countries that could force hundreds of thousands of people who have lived in the US for decades to leave. It's cut down on the number of refugees admitted through regular channels. It's tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, by which President Barack Obama gave temporarily relief to some undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. It's instituted a travel ban on certain countries that no longer specifically targets majority-Muslim nations, but did at its inception. It's slowed the green card process and reopened closed deportation cases and denied H-1B visas to professional workers.

This new rule reinterprets the past in the aim of further lowering legal immigration. But in key ways, the laws of earlier eras were patently racist and singled out specific groups of people, like women, Jews and people from India. It was not a fair system.

The same year Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1882, it did target an ethnic group when it cut off Chinese immigration under the Chinese Exclusion Act, despite Chinese American contributions to the development of the Western US and to the construction of the transcontinental railroad.

Some of the xenophobic rhetoric behind that law, which included that Chinese threatened US culture, would not sound strange coming out of President Donald Trump's mouth when he warns about threats to US culture.

It was a party reversal back then, with Republicans arguing for free immigration and many Democrats favoring exclusion, according to an official State Department history.

That 1882 law restricting Chinese immigration was only the beginning of ugly US laws aimed at the Chinese and other Asian subgroups. They remained in place until 1943.

In a report filed as a public comment against the new Department of Homeland Security rule, a group of historians noted that the system has evolved over time and in light of subsequent laws and court decisions. Some states have tried to strip benefits from immigrants but were denied by courts. Other states have sought to give immigrants some benefits when they are not eligible for federal assistance.

In the 1970s Congress cut off unauthorized immigrants from most benefits and did it again in 1996, with the support of President Bill Clinton, as part of refashioning the welfare system. However, legal immigrants have always had some level of access to aid when they needed it.

Some of the historians who signed the report objecting to Trump's change to the law wrote in The Washington Post when it was first suggested last year that when more than a million legal immigrants were entering the country each year in the early 20th century, very few were denied entry or deported using this reasoning. They examined the year 1916 and, of more than 1 million legal immigrants that year, found that fewer than 12,000 had been either denied entry or deported for being a "public charge."

Torrie Hester, Mary Mendoza, Deirdre Moloney and Mae Ngai wrote that Congress at that time specifically recognized that people who live in the U.S. create roots and families and that deporting them should not be undertaken lightly.

"Our immigration public-charge policy has always recognized two principles: first, the nation's desire for immigrants who are able-bodied and employable, capable of supporting themselves and their families; and second, our commitment to assist members of our communities who fall on hard times," they wrote, arguing that the rule "flies in the face of these long-held values."

In Wilmington, North Carolina, three dogs died after frolicking in a pond, while another succumbed after a swim in Lake Allatoona, Georgia. A common enemy likely led to the deaths of all four dogs: liver failure brought on by ingesting water contaminated with toxic blue-green algae.

These pets died in the same region, but toxic algae can be found all over the United States -- so dog owners throughout the nation need to be on the lookout.

What is toxic algae?

Algae occurs naturally in water, but the blue-green variety are considered Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are "primitive," photosynthetic organisms that can feed off the sun to make their own energy and release oxygen and possibly toxins in the process, said David G. Schmale III, a professor at Virginia Tech.

Some species produce potent toxins that can sicken or even kill people, pets and wildlife, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Blue-green algae and other HABs can produce different types of poisons, some that affect the liver, others the brain.

Schmale said he hasn't seen a coroner's report to verify the causes of death, still he speculates the dogs were thirsty and the water contaminated. "Samples of the water where the dogs were likely exposed will need to be tested" for toxins and bacteria to verify this, though, he said.

Where do these algae grow?

Harmful algae can bloom in both fresh and marine water. They've been observed in large freshwater lakes, smaller inland lakes, rivers, reservoirs and marine coastal areas and estuaries in all 50 states, according to Schmale.

Toxic algae can also grow in decorative ponds as well as backyard pools, providing homeowners with a good reason to properly sanitize swimming water.

What do toxic algae look like?

Toxic algae can look like foam, scum, or mats on the surface of water, said Schmale. Harmful algae blooms, which can be blue, vibrant green, brown or red, are sometimes mistaken for paint floating on the water.

Toxic algae often stink, sometimes producing a downright nauseating smell, yet animals may be attracted to the smell and taste of them, according to the EPA.

How do I know if my dog has been exposed?

Symptoms, which usually arise anywhere from 15 minutes to several days after exposure, include diarrhea or vomiting, weakness or staggering, drooling, difficulty breathing and convulsions or seizures, the EPA reports.

Immediately, take your pet to the vet if you see these symptoms.

Dogs, more than other pets, are especially vulnerable because of their tendency to play in water and so sometimes they drink the toxic algae, other times they lick it off their fur. Even dogs that avoid the water may be in danger. Many dogs like to scavenge the shore where they may find -- and eat -- drying clumps of algae.

One study identified 368 cases of toxic algae poisoning associated with dogs throughout the US over a nine-decade period, but the researchers believe this represents only "a small fraction of cases that occur throughout the US each year."

How do I keep my dog safe?

If you spot the algae, leave the area and don't let your dog drink or swim in the water. If your dog has already gotten into a harmful bloom, rinse your pet off immediately in fresh, clean water. Remember to wear gloves to protect yourself. And, if you know you've been in contact with the bloom, immediately wash with soap and water.

Can I be harmed by the algae?

When high concentrations of these cyanotoxins are consumed, they can poison not only domestic animals but also humans, said Schmale. Contact with toxic algae can cause rashes, stomach cramps, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.

Not only are these poisons present in water, but they can also accumulate along the food chain. "Ultimately, the entire food web is impacted because these toxins are produced," said Schmale. As a result, food contaminated with HABs have caused a variety of illnesses, and, in the most severe cases, lead to paralysis and respiratory failure, according the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Eating contaminated shellfish can cause symptoms within 15 minutes or up to 10 hours after finishing a meal. While mostly symptoms are mild, they can include tingling or numbness in the face, arms, and legs, headache, dizziness, loss of coordination and in rare cases, paralysis and respiratory failure.

Melissa Martin and Denise Mintz took their beloved dogs Abby, Izzy and Harpo to a pond in Wilmington on Thursday night to cool off. But within 15 minutes of leaving the pond, Abby, a West Highland white terrier, began to have a seizure.

Martin rushed her to a veterinary hospital, with Izzy and Harpo right behind her. Upon their arrival, Izzy, also a Westie, started seizing, and both terriers rapidly declined. Then Harpo, her 6-year-old "doodle" mix therapy dog, began to seize and show signs of liver failure.

By midnight Friday, all three dogs had died, she said.

The culprit, Martin's veterinarian said, was poisoning from blue-green algae present in the pond where they played.

"What started out as a fun night for them has ended in the biggest loss of our lives," Martin wrote in a Facebook post that has since been shared more than 15,000 times.

Martin told CNN she didn't notice the algae at first, but her veterinarian told her that what appeared to be debris from flowers were blooms of cyanobacteria.

She said she didn't see any signs warning of toxic algae near the pond, which sits next to a popular walking trail. It's her mission now, she says, to erect signs about toxic waters and warn pet owners about the blooms.

"I will not stop until I make positive change," she said. "I will not lose my dogs for nothing."

Blue-green algae is most common in the summer

Toxic algae blooms are more likely to infest bodies of fresh water when the weather is warm and waters are stagnant, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.

Some algal blooms leave a film of muck on the surface and make the water ruddy, but others are difficult to immediately detect, such as the blooms in the pond where Martin's dogs were exposed.

There's no cure for the poisoning, and exposure nearly always leads to death in dogs. Drinking from a body of water where blue-green algae lurks or licking it off fur can kill a dog within 15 minutes of exposure, according to Blue Cross for Pets, a UK animal charity.

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality periodically updates a map of the state where algae blooms have been reported, but in the case that a health notice isn't posted, it's best for humans and pets alike to avoid waters that smell bad or look odd in color or murky, the state's health and human services department said.

Hours after the August 4 attack, agents with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives visited the home of Ethan Kollie in nearby Kettering, according to a probable cause affidavit. Kollie told the agents he enjoyed firearms, owned two pistols and had bought body armor and a firearms accessory for Betts earlier this year, the affidavit says.

The 24-year-old allowed agents to search his home, where they smelled marijuana and saw a water pipe, commonly used to consume cannabis, and a Draco pistol, the affidavit says.

Agents interviewed Kollie again, this time at his place of employment, on Thursday. During that interview, Kollie told agents he had done hard drugs, marijuana and LSD with Betts several times a week between 2014 and 2015, the affidavit says.

He also told agents that he had smoked marijuana every day for the past decade, according to the affidavit.

When Kollie filled out the ATF paperwork to obtain the Draco pistol in May, the affidavit says, he checked the "no" box when asked whether he had been a regular user of marijuana or any other controlled substance.

Agents explained they were going to search Kollie, in accordance with a search warrant issued earlier that day, and Kollie produced a bag of marijuana and a .38 Special revolver, the affidavit says. He also told the agents that he grew psychedelic mushrooms at his home and explained the process to them, according to the affidavit.

"Kollie stated that he micro-doses the mushrooms on a constant basis, saying it provides him with energy and is 'fun,'" the affidavit says.

Asked why he lied on the federal firearms form, Kollie allegedly told agents that "if he told the truth about his drug use, he would not be allowed to purchase a firearm."

Though US Attorney Benjamin Glassman emphasized that Kollie did not intentionally help plan the Dayton shootings, the affidavit says Kollie acknowledged buying the body armor, a 100-round double drum magazine and an upper receiver for an AR-15, which is part of the gun's frame. All three items were used in the attack, authorities say.

"Kollie indicated that he purchased these items for Betts -- and stored them in Kollie's apartment -- to assist Betts in hiding them from Betts' parents," according to the affidavit.

Kollie also told agents that about 10 weeks before the shootings, at his Kettering apartment, he helped Betts assemble the AR-15 used in the attacks, the affidavit says.

About six to eight weeks ago, Betts returned to Kollie's apartment to pick up the assembled rifle, magazine and body armor, the affidavit says.

Agents seized the Draco pistol, another pistol, the waterpipe and a substance believed to be psychedelic mushrooms at Kollie's home Thursday, the affidavit says. He was arrested Friday and made an initial appearance later that day, Glassman said.

Kollie's attorney told CNN in an emailed statement that Kollie gave three separate interviews to federal authorities "to provide helpful information to aid investigators.

"He does not deny his friendship with Connor Betts and he was as shocked and surprised as everyone else that Mr. Betts committed the violent and senseless massacre in the Oregon District," Nick Gounaris, the attorney, said.

"We appreciate the United States Attorney stating that there was no indication that Mr. Kollie knew that he was assisting Betts in the shooting," the email said.

Kollie is being held in Montgomery County Jail, charged with possession of a firearm by someone who illegally uses or is addicted to a controlled substance, and making false statements with respect to information required by the federal firearms code.

He will have a detention hearing Wednesday to determine bail, Glassman said. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted on both counts, the prosecutor said.

Armed with a .223-caliber rifle and high-capacity magazines, Betts fired 41 shots in fewer than 30 seconds, killing his sister, Megan, and eight others in Dayton's entertainment district, police said.

Police officers on patrol fatally shot Betts shortly after he opened fire.

Though police have not announced a motive in the Dayton shooting, memories from former classmates and posts on his apparent Twitter account show that the gunman took a deep interest in violence and had easy access to powerful firearms.

He also expressed interest in committing a mass shooting, Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl said.

Dole Fresh Vegetables has issued a voluntary recall for baby spinach sold in 6-ounce bags and 10-ounce clamshell containers, with the use-by date of August 5, the company said in an alert from the US Food & Drug Administration.

No illnesses have been reported, the company said.

The recall is a precautionary measure after a sample of baby spinach tested positive for salmonella in Michigan, the company said.

The recalled product also was distributed in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin. The product is now expired and should no longer be available on shelves, the company said.

Anyone who may still have the product should throw it away, Dole said.

Salmonella is one of the most frequently reported foodborne illnesses in the United States, sickening an estimated 1.2 million people a year and killing approximately 450.

The bacteria can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea, as well as other symptoms that usually occur within eight to 72 hours of eating contaminated food.

In April, at least 117 people in 10 states were sickened by salmonella after eating precut melons, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In a variety of interviews and tweets -- including on Monday morning on CNN -- the former White House communications director (all 11 days' worth!) has insisted that the President is, in Mooch's mind, a nuclear reactor on the verge of a meltdown and therefore he no longer supports Trump.

"The guy's actually dissembling a little bit, and he's sounding more and more nonsensical," Scaramucci said on "New Day." "And, you know, we're sort anesthetized to it."

In a tweet shortly after that CNN interview, Scaramucci wrote this:

"To those asking, 'what took so long?' You're right. I tried to see best in @realDonaldTrump based on private interactions and select policy alignment. But his increasingly divisive rhetoric - and damage it's doing to fabric of our society - outweighs any short-term economic gain."

Scaramucci is entitled to his own opinion. But not his own facts. And the facts simply do not line up with the idea that Trump's rhetoric is getting worse or more divisive -- particularly of late. The facts suggest that Trump has always been exactly the person he is today. There's no meaningful change -- for the better or the worse -- in his behavior. Trump is, quite simply, just being Trump.

Consider this: Two years ago today, white nationalist marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, created a riot that left a woman -- Heather Heyer -- dead. In the wake of that incident, Trump blamed "both sides" -- the white supremacists and those who organized a counter-protest to them -- for Heyer's death.

"You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say it, but I will say it right now," Trump said at the time.

Not enough for you? How about these:

* Trump attacked a Gold Star family that spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2016

* Trump mocked and impersonated a disabled New York Times reporter

* Trump said Mexico was purposely sending rapists and criminals to the United States

* In an audio recording of an "Access Hollywood" interview, Trump made a series of misogynistic comments about women

* Trump said the late Sen. John McCain wasn't a war hero because he had been captured by the North Vietnamese

* Trump said that there was "blood coming out of her wherever" in reference to then-Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's treatment of him in a 2015 debate

* Trump said an American-born judge of Mexican descent had a conflict of interest in a case related to Trump University because the President had pushed for a wall to be built on our southern border.

* Trump alleged, without proof, that 3 to 5 million illegal votes had been cast in the 2016 election

There's more. So much more. But you get the idea.

What Scaramucci is doing is trying to soothe his own conscience. Trump wasn't always this bad! Therefore, supporting him for as long as I did was OK! Something has changed now! Something big!

Trump responded Monday to his former staffer's recent media appearances this way on Twitter: "Scaramucci, who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory, is only upset that I didn't want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be). Also, I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!"

The cold reality, of course, is that nothing has changed. Trump is who he has always been. There is no meltdown. There is no "he's getting worse."

Scaramucci knows that. He also should know better.

Donald Trump is the opposite. To know him is to hate him.

Many of those who have been closest to Trump just can't stand the guy. Anthony Scaramucci is the latest. The Mooch has had enough of Trump's "dissembling" -- a ten-dollar word for lying -- and his racism. He even thinks the GOP should consider dumping the President from the 2020 ticket.

I don't see a Republican groundswell for a Dump Trump movement, but it is interesting how many of those closest to Trump have already dumped him. Take Michael Cohen, please. Mr. Cohen was Trump's pit bull, his fixer, his consigliere. Cohen said he'd "take a bullet" for Trump. No more. Before decamping for the pokey, Cohen testified that his one-time hero is in fact "a racist, a con man, a cheat."

Omarosa Manigault Newman, who starred on Trump's reality show "The Apprentice" and worked for him in the White House, wrote in her tell-all that Trump is a racist who used the N-word on the set of the show. (Although she concedes she never personally heard him utter that epithet.)

Some of the President's most senior national security and economic advisers have been reported saying the most contemptuous things. Bob Woodward's book "Fear: Trump in the White House" is replete with examples:

• Former Defense Secretary James Mattis: After briefing Trump on a potential nuclear showdown with North Korea, Mattis -- a four-star Marine general -- is reported to have said, "the President acted like — and had the understanding of — a 'fifth or sixth grader.'" Mattis has denied that he made this statement.

• Gary Cohn, former chair of Trump's National Economic Council, called Trump "a professional liar." Cohn has denied Woodward's claims.

• Former White House chief of staff -- and another Marine general -- John Kelly called the Trump White House "crazytown," and is reported to have called his boss "unhinged," "off the rails," and "an idiot." Kelly denied that he called the President an idiot and called Woodward's book "B.S."

• Veteran attorney and former Trump lawyer John Dowd told Woodward of a practice session of questions and answers with Trump, as if Dowd were Mueller. Dowd's conclusion? Trump is "a f---ing liar." Dowd has denied this claim. • Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who rose to CEO of Exxon-Mobil, reportedly concluded his boss was "a moron." Tillerson didn't confirm or deny that he made the claim. But he later told CBS News' Bob Schieffer Trump is "a man who's undisciplined, doesn't like to read, doesn't read briefing reports, doesn't like to get into the details of a lot of things..." This sometimes led Trump to demand actions that were not legal, Tillerson told Schieffer.

Apparently the major river flowing through Washington is not the Potomac, it's Denial. Back in my days in the Clinton White House, Woodward quoted me saying unkind (but hilarious) things about some of my colleagues. But I didn't even try to deny saying them. You know why? 'Cause I said them. I suspect these folks did as well.

But here's the other side of the coin: The further you get from Trump the more some folks love him. He is beloved by rural, older, non-college educated white folks, people who would be kicked out on their keisters if they showed up at Mar-a-Lago. Trump probably wouldn't be caught dead in their ZIP codes, but he believes -- perhaps correctly -- "I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters."

That may be. But it's also true that a whole lot of the people who know Donald Trump best have thrown him under the bus.

The comments to CNN's John Berman come following a weekend in which Scaramucci and Trump traded barbs. The former hedge fund manager has increasingly criticized Trump's racist rhetoric as well as his recent visits to the scenes of mass shootings.

Asked by Berman on "New Day" if he was "no longer an active supporter of President Trump and his reelection bid," the former Trump loyalist replied, "I think that's pretty obvious from over the weekend."

"The guy's actually dissembling a little bit, and he's sounding more and more nonsensical. And, you know, we're sort anesthetized to it," he added, referring to the President's rhetoric and behavior.

Scaramucci's public break with Trump makes him the latest loyalist to cut ties with the President. Some other high-profile allies, including former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and personal attorney Michael Cohen, have also distanced themselves from Trump after once vigorously defending him in public.

Trump appeared to be angry over the weekend with Scaramucci after he called the President's recent visits to the grief-stricken cities of El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, following two mass shootings a "catastrophe."

Asked Monday if he was calling for changing the Republican ticket, Scaramucci replied, "Well, I'm calling for it to be considered, yes."

"I think you have to consider a change at the top of the ticket when someone is acting like this," said Scaramucci, who didn't name a potential replacement candidate, instead saying, "Let's watch how this unfolds."

The former aide said that although he believes Trump's policies are "very, very good for the American people," the President's "rhetoric is so charged and so divisive that we have to all just take a step back now and say, 'what are we doing, actually?'"

"He goes after individuals as the President of the United States on his Twitter account, OK, which incites hate, which incites death threats," he said, adding later, "The racially charged comments, the divisive tweeting, the nonsense coming from the President is not helping the country."

In a tweet following the CNN interview, Scaramucci said he had held off on distancing himself from Trump because he "tried to see best" in him "based on private interactions and select policy alignment."

Responding to Scaramucci's comments to CNN, the White House on Monday said he had no credibility.

"He worked at the White House for less than two weeks and is certainly no expert on this President," White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. "This is all self-serving on his part and the media plays right into it. It's embarrassing to watch."

Trump himself later hit out at his former communications director.

"Scaramucci, who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory, is only upset that I didn't want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be)," Trump tweeted. "Also, I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!"

'Eventually he turns on everyone'

On Saturday, Trump ripped into Scaramucci in a pair of tweets, writing that the former aide, who served in the administration for 11 days in 2017, was fired "from a position that he was totally incapable of handling." Noting that Scaramucci regularly appears on TV, he added: "Anthony, who would do anything to come back in, should remember the only reason he is on TV, and it's not for being the Mooch!"

The President's tweets came several says after Scaramucci said last week on MSNBC that Trump's recent visits to El Paso and Dayton were a "catastrophe." On Monday, he told Berman of Trump's trips, "the only thing (Trump) was doing in those areas was talking about himself and praising himself and crowd sizes. And so it just -- one day after the next it gets worse and worse and worse."

Responding in a tweet on Sunday to Trump's attacks, Scaramucci said that although he's "fully" supported Trump over the last three years, "Recently, he has said things that divide the country in a way that is unacceptable," adding, "Eventually he turns on everyone and soon it will be you and then the entire country."

Scaramucci's ousting in July 2017 came shortly after an infamous, expletive-laden interview he gave to The New Yorker in which he ripped top White House officials by name. In many of his post-White House TV appearances he has defended Trump, while also making public appeals about curtailing some of his behavior and changing policies, including a suggestion on CNN last year for Trump to "dial down the lying."

"For the last 3 years I have fully supported this President," Scaramucci tweeted Sunday morning. "Recently he has said things that divide the country in a way that is unacceptable. So I didn't pass the 100% litmus test. Eventually he turns on everyone and soon it will be you and then the entire country."

Scaramucci's Sunday tweet comes after Trump appeared to be angry with the former White House communications director for calling the President's recent visits to the grief-stricken cities of El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, following two mass shootings a "catastrophe."

The President responded late Saturday by ridiculing Scaramucci, who worked for the Trump administration for 11 days in July 2017, for his short stint in the Trump administration.

"Anthony Scaramucci, who was quickly terminated (11 days) from a position that he was totally incapable of handling, now seems to do nothing but television as the all time expert on 'President Trump,'" Trump wrote in a tweet.

"Like many other so-called television experts, he knows very little about me," he wrote, adding, "Anthony, who would do anything to come back in, should remember the only reason he is on TV, and it's not for being the Mooch!"

Scaramucci, who regularly appears as a guest on TV news shows, said during his MSNBC appearance that Trump's trip to visit with victims of mass shootings in two cities fell short.

"So look, the President didn't do well on the trip," the former aide said. Some of Trump's current aides conceded last week that his visits to El Paso and Dayton did not go as planned. New video revealed that Trump bragged about crowd sizes while visiting patients at a Texas hospital.

Last month, after Trump tweeted racist attacks at four minority congresswomen, Scaramucci said on Twitter that the tweets were "racist and unacceptable." The former aide has also previously criticized the President for repeating falsehoods, saying on CNN last year that Trump "is a liar."

Scaramucci's ousting in 2017 came shortly after an infamous, expletive-laden interview he gave to The New Yorker in which he ripped top White House officials by name. In many of his post-White House TV appearances he has defended Trump, while also making public appeals about curtailing some of his behavior and changing policies.

The regulations reflect the Trump administration's latest move to overhaul the nation's environmental frameworks -- in this case, a law credited with saving the bald eagle and grizzly bear from extinction.

The overhaul changes how the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration consider whether species qualify for protections, as well as how the agencies determine what habitats deserve special protections. It could significantly lengthen how long it takes for a species to become protected, which could further endanger them, but the Trump administration says it allows the focus to be on the "rarest species."

"The best way to uphold the Endangered Species Act is to do everything we can to ensure it remains effective in achieving its ultimate goal -- recovery of our rarest species," Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a statement Monday. "An effectively administered Act ensures more resources can go where they will do the most good: on-the-ground conservation."

The final rule was panned by environmental groups that question Bernhardt's motives, given his past work representing oil and gas companies.

"This effort to gut protections for endangered and threatened species has the same two features of most Trump administration actions: it's a gift to industry, and it's illegal. We'll see the Trump administration in court about it," Drew Caputo, Earthjustice vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife, and oceans. said in a statement. Other environmental groups and some states are also expected to sue.

Climate crisis

One million species are threatened by human activity, according to a United Nations report earlier this year. Shrinking habitat, exploitation of natural resources, climate change and pollution are the main drivers of species loss and are threatening more than 40% of amphibians, 33% of coral reefs and over a third of all marine mammals with extinction, the report states.

"The climate crisis underlies so much of the extinction crisis," but the rule could make it more difficult to use the climate data to protect species in the US, said Rebecca Riley, legal director of the nature program for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

"They're trying to narrow the evidence we can consider and narrow the scope of time we're going to be projecting the impact on these species ... limit the forward-looking data," like climate models, Riley said. "It's very technical but they're all designed to make it harder to protect species."

Riley said the rule would also create an exemption to critical habitats that exist because of the results of the climate crisis such as sea level rise.

"It looks like they're trying to say, if you are a sea- ice dependent species we're not going to protect that sea ice habitat as critical habitat," she said.

Gary Frazer, the assistant director for endangered species at the Fish and Wildlife Service, said the change in the rule is needed because longer-term models can change.

"We also are clear that we're continuing to make listing determinations as directed by the statute solely on the basis of the best available scientific information and without consideration for the economic impacts," Frazer said.

Frazer said that reliable data -- including in areas such as land use planning -- can only be developed "for the next 30 or 40 or 50 years."

"When you start reaching out to 70 or 80 years, the confidence that anyone has in what the future -- those future conditions are like starts to degrade significantly," he said.

This story has been updated.

It turns out Speaker Nancy Pelosi might have been onto something when she talked about Trump being "almost self-impeaching" several months ago. This August, Trump seems to be on a path of impeaching himself.

Despite the continued skepticism from Democratic leaders, the drive toward impeachment has accelerated. Over 50% of House Democrats, including some legislators from moderate swing districts, have announced their support for impeachment proceedings.

Even House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, the emerging moral conscience of the party, said that he favors an impeachment inquiry, and contended that formal impeachment proceedings are already underway. He told CNN's Erin Burnett: "This is formal impeachment proceedings. We are investigating all the evidence, gathering the evidence. And we will (at the) conclusion of this -- hopefully by the end of the year -- vote to (send) articles of impeachment to the House floor. Or we won't. That's a decision that we'll have to make. But that's exactly the process we're in right now."

Nadler has done more than any other senior Democrat in talking about the "I" word and making the case to the public for moving forward with hearings -- the job of opposition leaders in these historic moments.

It is not clear that Robert Mueller's testimony before the House is the reason the impeachment process has accelerated. While the substance of Mueller's presentation was devastating, just like the written report, Trump himself has been the driving force in energizing Democrats to take a stand.

Trump has continued to do more than anyone else to maintain the political momentum necessary to prevent Democrats from putting the impeachment option aside. While the notion of self-impeachment is silly, it is true that Trump's own egregious actions forced Democrats to continue thinking about the kinds of dramatic steps that might be necessary to contain this runaway presidency.

Trump's ongoing acceptance of white nationalist rhetoric, if not politics, continues to unsettle many across the country. It started with his tweet that said that the four young Democratic legislators who have been among his most vocal critics should "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came," and continued with his racially saturated Twitter blast against Baltimore, and Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings. And then there was the horrific shooting in El Paso where the crazed killer allegedly used the same word -- "invasion"-- as the President to describe immigrants in a manifesto before he prepared to murder innocent Mexicans in a Walmart.

The President's subsequent response in El Paso -- giving a thumbs up next to a baby orphaned in the shooting during a staged photo-op -- just made things worse.

In other words, the reason that impeachment is on the table has less to do with the Mueller report than the President's own actions. In the same way that President Andrew Johnson's attacks on Reconstruction fueled the impeachment drive against him, the President's far right agenda is emboldening Democrats to consider voting for impeachment -- even if Senate Republicans will inevitably prevent his removal from office.

The worse that the President behaves, and the clearer the real world impact of his actions becomes, the easier it will be for Democrats to go on record saying that obstructing justice in a serious investigation is unacceptable. He tried, it would seem based on the Mueller report, to stifle the investigators in ways that President Richard Nixon would never have imagined possible.

We are still far away from that kind of vote. The fears that Pelosi has about a backlash to impeachment in moderate districts are very real and have not disappeared. Until she has the entire Democratic Caucus behind her, she will likely be reluctant to give her full support.

Trump, however, keeps making it difficult to just say no. His presidency is off the rails, and he is playing with a fire of racism, nativism and social division that is dangerous -- if not deadly. His rhetoric keeps getting more explosive as the election heats up. His retweet about the Clintons takes us into new "unprecedented" territory about just how far he will go.

Throughout his time in office, Trump has been his own worst enemy. Any other incumbent president with relative peace abroad, a good economy and a united party would be sitting pretty for reelection. However, he shows the nation every day the immense risks of giving him power. There is a reason his approval ratings have remained historically low and that he has never been able to crack majority support.

Trump will only get worse, not better. Those who keep waiting for a "turning point" to normalcy are just not paying attention. The more heated that the 2020 campaign becomes, the more aggressive he will be. Every pillar of his rhetorical arsenal -- embracing nativism, demanding investigations and spreading conspiracy theories, dismissing law and order, and character assassination -- will remain front and center. With each swipe at this opponents, he will keep giving Democrats more fodder to take dramatic action to, at a minimum, go on record about why this kind of use of presidential power is not acceptable.

The suspect, identified as 21-year-old Philip Manshaus by Norway's public service broadcaster NRK, appeared in court on charges of murder and terrorism.

It's unclear where the marks on his face came from.

Oslo District Police Attorney Paal-Fredrik Hjort Kraby told CNN that they are aware that his name was published on state media but they would not confirm it to CNN. The suspect's attorney would not confirm his name either.

Prosecutors will ask for Manshaus to be imprisoned for four weeks, with full isolation, as well as letter, visitor and media bans, according to a statement released by police on Monday,

"The prosecution will request closed doors to the prison meeting for the sake of danger of forfeiture, as the investigation is at an early stage and the accused has not provided an explanation to the police," the statement said.

Overpowered

The suspect was overpowered on Saturday by a 65-year-old man during the attack at the Al-Noor Islamic Center in Baerum, a district just west of Oslo.

Police said Monday that Manshaus wore a GoPro camera on a helmet as he entered the mosque.

Oslo District Police Attorney Paal Fredrik Hjort Kraby told media that investigators have secured the recordings from the camera, which they consider evidence.

Imran Mushtaq, a board member at the Al-Noor mosque, told NRK that more than a dozen people were praying inside the mosque just 10 minutes before the suspect arrived. But by the time the shooting began, only three older men were left inside.

The suspect entered by shooting through the mosque's locked glass door, Mushtaq said. Two weapons were found inside the mosque and are believed to be connected to the suspect, police said.

Shortly after the attack, investigators found the body of a young woman at the suspect's home in Baerum.

The victim is the 17-year-old stepsister of the suspect, whom Oslo police identified as Johanne Zhangjia Ihle-Hansen on Monday.

Superintendent Rune Skjold told reporters Sunday that the suspect had expressed right-wing sympathies online. He had praised figures like Vidkun Quisling, the leader of Norway under Nazi occupation during World War II.

According to the Office of Inspector General's report released Friday, 96% of embassies and consulates and 95% of domestic bureaus and offices who responded to OIG's surveys said the hiring freeze "had a somewhat negative or very negative effect on overall operations." Some 97% of embassies and consulates and 100% of bureaus and offices told OIG that the freeze negatively impacted employee morale and welfare.

President Donald Trump instituted the hiring freeze upon taking office in January 2017. The Office of Management and Budget lifted the freeze in mid-April of that year, but the State Department continued the freeze for another 13 months under the tenure of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mike Pompeo resumed hiring in May 2018, after becoming secretary of state.

The OIG report, which was ordered by Congress and based on responses from 38 bureaus and offices and 151 overseas posts, found that "several bureaus charged with protecting security, health, and life safety reported to OIG that the hiring freeze had significant detrimental effects on their operations."

The Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), for example, reported a number of adverse repercussions as a result of the freeze. Among those were the inability to staff its command center -- which "operates 24 hours a day to monitor and report information regarding threats against US diplomatic missions, the Secretary, and American citizens abroad" -- at the recommended levels.

"DS said that even staffing the center with the minimum staff needed to operate contributed to employee burnout and fatigue and led to coverage gaps that could have significantly affected its ability to respond to overseas security crises," the report said.

The Bureau of Overseas Building Operations said "it conducted 22% fewer overseas safety, health, and environmental management inspections in 2018 than in 2016" due to the freeze. Americans seeking consular services abroad faced longer wait times during the freeze, the report found.

Impacts on counterterrorism, law enforcement

Domestically, the Bureau of Medical Services told OIG that "staffing shortages during the hiring freeze affected its ability to provide support services for special needs children of overseas employees, process employee medical clearances, and advise on suitability reviews in cases involving mental health issues, including suitability determinations for law enforcement officers authorized to carry weapons."

The report found that the freeze negatively impacted oversight and management of millions of dollars in foreign assistance programs, including ones related to counterterorrism, global health, narcotics and law enforcement and humanitarian aid.

The inspector general's report could not determine the costs of the hiring freeze "because the Department did not systematically track these costs." The report noted anecdotal accounts of increased overtime and travel costs as a result of the freeze.

The man was having surgery to remove a harmless lump in his abdominal wall, but the operating team neglected to take out his dentures before the operation.

He returned to the hospital six days later complaining of blood in his mouth and difficulties breathing and swallowing, which had prevented him from eating solid food.

Ultimately, more surgery was needed to resolve the problem, which was revealed in a case report published by the British Medical Journal on Monday. Lead author Harriet Cunniffe, from James Paget Hospital in eastern England, is calling for surgeons to ensure dentures are removed from patients before an operation.

During the patient's first return to the emergency room, doctors were unable to diagnose the problem and the unnamed man was sent home with a prescription for mouthwash, antibiotics and steroids.

But he returned two days later with worsening symptoms and was admitted to the hospital with suspected aspiration pneumonia -- a severe chest infection.

Eventually a diagnostic procedure identified a semicircular object lying across his vocal cords, which had caused internal blistering and swelling.

The man, who said he had lost his dentures during his initial visit to hospital, was subsequently rushed into surgery to remove the false teeth. He remained in the hospital for another six days.

He returned suffering complications on multiple occasions over the following month, before eventually healing.

The authors of the study wrote: "There are no set national guidelines on how dentures should be managed during anaesthesia, but it is known that leaving dentures in during bag-mask ventilation allows for a better seal during induction (when the anaesthetic is being infused), and therefore many hospitals allow dentures to be removed immediately before intubation (when a tube is inserted into the airway to assist breathing)."

"In addition to reminding us of the risks of leaving dentures in during induction of anaesthesia when the Swiss cheese model of errors aligns, this case also highlights a number of important learning points," they added.

"The first is to always listen to your patient. It has long been known that one gets the majority of the information needed to form a diagnosis based on the patients' history."

The Trump administration will delay some tariffs against China on cellphones, laptop computers, toys and some other items until Dec. 15, softening the blow of levies that were scheduled to take effect on Sept. 1 against roughly $300 billion of imports.

The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said that some products will be removed from the tariff lists entirely, based on health, safety, national security and other factors. The statement didn’t say which items would be removed.

The USTR said it would release precise details of the delayed tariffs later Tuesday, but the items that will be delayed are some of the biggest ticket items facing tariffs. Just cellphones and laptops represent about $80 billion of trade, more than a quarter of the tariffs that were posed to take effect, with a 10% levy, in just a few weeks.

The USTR didn’t provide a reason beyond saying the decision was “part of USTR’s public comment and hearing process.” In June, over the course of seven days of hearings, hundreds of U.S. companies testified that the tariffs would damage their business.

The delay in tariffs also buys a reprieve for negotiators. Talks between the U.S. and Chinese negotiating teams, in Shanghai last month, ended without a breakthrough, and a Chinese delegation was planning to visit Washington in September, shortly after the tariffs were scheduled to take affect. Now, the U.S. and China will have another opportunity to strike a deal and avert the tariffs.

The stock market soared on the news of yet another potential thaw in the tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 400 points, or nearly 1.7%, in morning trade Tuesday.

Apple Inc. surged more than 4.5% on news that smartphones, including its iPhone would be spared until at least December from the proposed tariffs.

The reprieve is the second break the Trump administration has granted Apple. The company last year dodged duties on its smartwatches and wireless earbuds after the U.S. excluded those gadgets from planned tariffs.

The move is the latest seesawing in the talks between Washington and Beijing. The tariffs in question—on roughly $300 billion in goods—were first announced in May following a breakdown in U.S.-China talks. They would have come atop the roughly $250 billion in goods from China already facing tariffs, and would result in nearly every item imported from China facing a duty.

Then, President Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping reached a truce at a summit in Osaka, Japan, in late June and these tariffs were placed on hold.

But by late July, the Trump administration blamed China for not moving quickly enough to purchase agricultural goods, a move that China said it hadn’t agreed to in the first place. It was after those talks in late July that the Trump administration said it would impose this round of tariffs on Sept. 1.

Now a substantial part of those tariffs is delayed.

The USTR also said that it would have an exclusion process for the newest round of tariffs, meaning that individual companies will have the ability to avoid the duties if they successfully make the case that their business would be unduly harmed.

The Trump administration on Tuesday narrowed the list of Chinese products it plans to impose new tariffs on as of Sept. 1, delaying levies on cellphones, laptop computers, toys and other goods and announcing exclusions for other products for various reasons.

The United States trade representative’s office said that a new 10 percent tariff on roughly half the Chinese goods imported into the United States would still take effect on Sept. 1 as announced by President Trump.

But tariffs on consumer electronics, video game consoles, certain toys, computer monitors and some footwear and clothing items are being delayed until Dec. 15, giving retailers time to stockpile the products they need for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.

The administration added that certain products were being removed from the tariff list “based on health, safety, national security and other factors.”

Stocks rallied on the news, with the S&P 500 climbing nearly 2 percent in morning trading. The benchmark index was lifted, in part, by stocks of retailers and computer chip producers, two industries that have been sensitive to indications that trade tensions were getting either better or worse.

Best Buy, which gets a many of the products it sells from China, was among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500, up more than 8 percent in morning trading. The Nasdaq composite index rose more than 2 percent.

The adjustments to the threatened tariffs come as the Trump administration faces mounting pressure from businesses and consumer groups who say the continuing trade war with China is hurting them. Mr. Trump has been pressing Beijing since last year to make a trade deal that would, among other things, strengthen protections for American intellectual property, open Chinese markets to American business and result in China buying large quantities of American energy and agricultural goods.

But negotiators for the United States and China have made little progress since May, when progress stalled out over several issues. The stumbling blocks include whether Mr. Trump would roll back the 25 percent tariffs the administration has already imposed on roughly $250 billion of Chinese goods and whether Beijing would enshrine in law the reforms it has pledged to make.

Liu He, China’s vice premier and the country lead trade negotiator, spoke with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, on Tuesday, and the three agreed to speak again in two weeks, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump criticized China for not making large purchases of American farm goods, suggesting that the tariffs might force them into action.

“As usual, China said they were going to be buying ‘big’ from our great American Farmers,” he wrote. “So far they have not done what they said. Maybe this will be different!”

If you want to live in a big city but have a tight budget, you may want to avoid places such as Miami and and Denver, where housing costs are rising year over year.

That’s according to a recent report from Rent.com on the cost of city living, which analyzed data from the 2016 and 2017 editions of the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey, which is conducted annually by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report looked at the change in housing costs in 22 major metropolitan areas over 12 months.

In addition to mortgages and rental costs, the BLS includes property taxes, maintenance, utilities, household products and furnishings in its definition of housing costs.

Of the areas surveyed, Miami experienced the most significant increase in housing costs between 2016 and 2017, spending an average of 8.2% more on housing over the course of the year. That can be attributed in part to the fact that mortgage costs rose faster than local wages over the same period, the Miami New Times reports.

St. Louis saw the second highest rise in housing spending with an average increase of 7.8%. That made an impact: Between 2016 to 2017, the percentage of St. Louis residents who are severely cost-burdened, meaning they spend 50% or more on housing, increased more than 2%, according to a survey from Apartment List.

Here’s the full list of the 10 U.S. cities that saw the biggest increases in housing costs between 2016 and 2017:

Miami, Florida: 8.2% increase
St. Louis, Missouri: 7.8% increase
Denver, Colorado: 7.1% increase
Boston, Massachusetts: 6.7% increase
Washington D.C.: 6% increase
Seattle, Washington: 5.8% increase
San Francisco, California: 5.5% increase
Houston, Texas: 3.9% increase
Atlanta, Georgia: 3.8% increase
New York, New York: 3.5% increase
However, many major cities have actually gotten cheaper. In Minneapolis, housing spending dropped 6.7% on average, followed by Baltimore with a 4.2% decrease and Chicago with a 3.7% decrease.

Regardless of location, housing costs take up a significant portion of city dwellers’ paychecks. In 2017, the national average for income spent on housing was 27%, the report found. While that falls beneath the recommended 30%, it still means many are spending above what is considered financially manageable.

Residents of Los Angeles and Boston put an average of 31.8% and 30.5%, respectively, of their income toward housing in 2017, the report found. In New York City, residents spent an average of 29.6% of their income on housing, nearly exceeding the 30% mark.

Is the high cost of living in a major city worth it? Just over half (55%) of survey respondents say yes. Another 30.7% say no and 14.3% are neutral. But that doesn’t mean city dwellers want to stay forever: 78% of respondents say they are open to moving at some point and 12.4% say they want to move away as soon as possible. Just 9.6% say they want to stay put for the rest of their lives.

When determining whether to live in a big city or somewhere cheaper, it ultimately comes down to your circumstances and priorities. If job security or earning a higher salary are among your reasons for living in a big city, you’re probably in the right place, given that cities are often considered hot spots for high-paying jobs.

But if you choose to live somewhere more affordable, you might find it easier to achieve the lifestyle you want without needing to cut back on things like entertainment or dining out.

Still weighing your options? Here’s an idea of where to buy if you want to become a city-dwelling homeowner for less. And if quality of life is what you truly care about, these 10 cities are ranked highly.

When most people think about innovative companies in 2019, they picture the ones dominating the headlines like Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook. Interestingly, another company consistently tops U.S. patent rankings year after year. That company is IBM and it was granted substantially more patents than any other company once again in 2018. That's according to the Intellectual Property Owners Association which released its list of the organizations receiving the most U.S. utility patents in July.

Based on data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the ranking shows that IBM was granted 9,088 patents in 2018, the 26th consecutive year it has topped America's patent league. It led the way in the fields of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, security and quantum computing-related patent grants. Many of the usual suspects are present at the top of the list with South Korean tech giant Samsung second with 5,836 patents granted, ahead of Japanese photographic manufacturer Canon’s 3,206. Elsewhere on the list, Google's parent-company Alphabet comes sixth with 2,597 patents granted while Apple is in eleventh place with 2,147.

GARDAÍ IN GALWAY are investigating the sudden death of a teenager who fell ill at her Debs dance last night.

Jessica Moore (19) was a pupil at St Raphael’s College in Loughrea and was attending the event at a hotel in Ballinasloe.

An ambulance was called after she felt unwell at around 2am last night, and she was taken to Portiuncula Hospital where she was later pronounced dead.

The coroner has been notified, and a post-mortem examination is due to take place tomorrow.

Investigations remain ongoing at this time, gardaí said.

Her family described Jessica as the “cherished and much-loved sister” to two siblings while the “inexpressible grief” of her parents is also detailed in the death notice on RIP.ie.

The 19 year old will be laid to rest on Thursday afternoon at St Patrick’s Church in Bullaun.

Strait of Hormuz -- The White House is keeping up its push for allies to join an international military coalition to protect commercial shipping in the vital waterway that connects the oil-rich Persian Gulf to the rest of the world. Iran warned on Tuesday that such a bolstered naval presence in the Strait of Hormuz would only increase the "risk of combustion" in the region.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called on the international community to step up pressure on Iran until it stops what he calls "destabilizing behavior."

His counterpart, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif -- who was recently sanctioned by the U.S. government -- has used the same language to cast blame for the escalating tension in the region at Washington.

A variety of governments -- including those of Japan, Germany, Ireland, The Bahamas and New Zealand -- offer similar travel advisories to their citizens, USA Today reports.

“Heeding to the possibility that shooting incidents could happen anywhere in the U.S., which is a gun society, please continue to stay alert as a precautionary measure,” the Consulate General of Japan said in a recent statement.

The Bahamas advises “young males” to be especially careful when interacting with the police.

These warnings were brought to President Donald Trump’s attention last Friday when he was taking questions from the press corps outside the White House. The president said he wasn’t aware of such advisories, then added he would retaliate against any country that issued them.

“Well, I can’t imagine that,” he said. “But if they did that, we’d just reciprocate. We are a very reciprocal nation with me as the head. When somebody does something negative to us in terms of a country, we do it to them.”

The mass shootings this month in Texas and Ohio have led some countries to highlight warnings about traveling to the U.S., but such advisories are nothing new. They bring attention not just to the incidence of violence and racism in the country but also various benign cultural differences, such as the relative acceptability of nudity.

The US economy doesn’t have enough workers.

For a record 16 straight months, the number of open jobs has been higher than the number of people looking for work. The US economy had 7.4 million job openings in June, but only 6 million people were looking for work, according to data released by the US Department of Labor.

This is not normal. Ever since Labor began tracking job turnover two decades ago, there have always been more people looking for work than jobs available. That changed for the first time in January 2018. Just look at the chart below.

Employers have been complaining about a shortage of skilled workers in recent years, particularly workers with advanced degrees in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields. Nearly every industry now has a labor shortage, but here’s the twist: Employers are having a harder time filling blue-collar positions than professional positions that require a college education.

The hardest-to-find workers are no longer computer engineers. They are home health care aides, restaurant workers, and hotel staff. The shift is happening because more and more Americans are going to college and taking professional jobs, while working-class baby boomers are retiring en masse.

This means that for once, low-skilled workers have the most leverage in the current labor market.

One way to measure that leverage is to see how many workers are quitting their jobs. When more people are quitting than getting fired, that’s a sign of a healthy labor market. It means people are finding better-paying jobs, or feel confident that they will. And, sure enough, a record number of workers are quitting.

In April, 3.5 million workers quit their jobs — the highest number ever recorded in a single month (check out the red line in the graph below). Meanwhile, layoffs and firings remain at record-low levels.

Who are the workers quitting at the highest rates? Restaurant and food catering workers, followed by those in the hotel and tourism industry. Both industries rely on a large number of low-paid workers. The fact that so many are quitting suggests that workers are fed up with crappy jobs.

It “indicates that workers are feeling more confident in their jobs prospects to quit in search of better opportunities,” writes economist Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute.

While a labor shortage seems like something for President Donald Trump to brag about, there is one troubling sign: The total number of job openings is decreasing. That means economic growth could continue to slow. That’s bad news for the president.

But in the meantime, there’s no better time for working-class Americans to demand better wages, benefits, schedules, and work conditions. It also means immigration reform is more urgent than ever. In order to fill all the open jobs and keep the economy growing, Congress will need to allow more low-skilled immigrants to work — legally.

The numbers are pretty clear about what comes next. If 7.4 million jobs are open and only 6 million people are looking for work, then employers need to find a lot more workers. They need to encourage more Americans to join the workforce.

Right now there are about 1.5 million people who are considered “marginally attached” to the US labor force and who are not counted as job seekers. They are people who would like to work but don’t need to, or can’t work because of other responsibilities. Their most common reasons for not working are because they’re enrolled in school or taking care of family members, according to the Labor Department.

Economists agree that employers need to do more to entice workers to join the labor market. They need to sweeten the deal.

“Companies looking to attract enough blue-collar workers will have to continue increasing wages and, as a result, possibly experience diminished profits,” wrote Gad Levanon, chief economist for North America at the Conference Board, a global economic research organization that has studied the recent US labor shortage.

Slow income growth has been the most persistent problem affecting the US economy in its recovery from the Great Recession. Wages have barely kept up with the cost of living, even as the unemployment rate dropped and the economy expanded.

With such a tight labor market and rising productivity, workers should expect much bigger pay raises than they’re getting.

Private sector workers (excluding farmworkers) got a measly 8-cent average hourly raise in July, adding up to an average pay of $27.98 an hour. Workers’ wages only grew about 1.6 percent in the past year, after adjusting for inflation.

While that’s faster than wages have been growing since the recession started in 2007, it’s still a pathetic amount compared to the sky-high payouts corporate CEOs are getting.

But raising wages will only do so much to ease the labor shortage. Businesses will need to hire more foreign workers too.

The US economy needs more low-skilled immigrants
The new labor market data shows a lot of unfilled jobs that require college degrees — about 1 million in the professional business service sector. But there are even more open jobs that don’t require that much education.

These are the kinds of jobs that low-skilled immigrants, often from Latin America, have long helped fill. But Trump’s restrictions on immigration threaten to make the labor shortage worse. Since taking office, his administration has tried to scale back nearly every avenue of legal immigration, ignoring the high demand for unskilled immigrant workers, even though he employs undocumented workers at his own golf clubs.

Trump’s most recent immigration proposal would revamp the current legal immigration system, which currently prioritizes immigrants with family ties to the US. The new green card system would instead favor immigrants with high levels of education, English-language fluency, and professional skills. Most of the green cards would go to immigrants under a point system that ranks applicants based on certain criteria, such as professional skills, education level, age, and English fluency. So Trump would like to make it even harder for unskilled immigrants to come to the US.

In 2017, the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board warned Trump that his restrictions on immigration could hurt the economy.

“If President Trump wants employers to produce and build more in America, the US will need to improve education and skills in manufacturing and IT. But the economy will also need more foreign workers, and better guest worker programs to bring them in legally,” the publication said in March 2017.

Darrell West, a Brookings expert on technology and public policy, pointed out in 2013 that the US economy would suffer if Congress didn’t overhaul the immigration system:

America’s immigration system is not designed for today’s economy, and remains largely unchanged since 1965. In fact, of the approximately one million green cards given out by the US in 2011, around 139,000 (or 13 percent) were given out for economic reasons, a number far too small to meet the needs of the world’s largest economy.

Providing more work visas for skilled and unskilled immigrants seems like an obvious solution to ease the labor shortage. But it’s also the solution Trump seems least inclined to take.

The southern half of the United States is far less resilient than the northern half, according to a groundbreaking federal study that analyzed factors such as income inequality and religious affiliation in every county.

But one of the least resilient counties, oddly, is New York County, better known as Manhattan, which suffers because residents eschew personal automobiles.

The study, done for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, takes a unique approach to studying resilience by measuring individuals’ financial stability as well as their connection to their community. There is no mention of typical resilience measures such as the quality of infrastructure or physical protection from natural hazards. Nor does the study consider risk factors such as exposure to flooding and hurricanes.

“It’s knowing your neighbors,” said Kyle Burke Pfeiffer, one of the study’s authors and leader of the National Preparedness Analytics Group at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. “Having relationships allows you to do many things, such as provide care and share flashlights. It helps one think about checking on your neighbors, maybe even building communities with a resilient mindset.”

The states with the lowest resilience are roughly the same as the states in which the most number of federal disasters have occurred since 1953, according to an E&E News analysis of FEMA records.

Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Kentucky and Mississippi all rank in the top 10 in the total number of disasters. Yet in each of those states, a majority of the counties received low or mediocre resilience rankings.

Argonne Lab researchers used publicly available data to compare each of the 3,141 counties in the United States in 20 social and economic categories. Many of the categories are predictable, such as unemployment and homeownership rates, median household income, and the percentage of high school graduates. But many are less obvious.

The study rates each county on income inequality, which, research shows, can hinder a cohesive response to disaster. “When income inequality is present, earnings tend to be distributed in a way that does not support broader community goals,” the study says.

“Circles of wealth tend to congregate with other circles of wealth and they create ... an informal class system, particularly in urban areas,” Pfeiffer said.

Income inequality is highest across broad swaths of the Southeast and Southwest and lowest in the Midwest and the Washington, D.C., area, where many residents work for the federal government.

The study is part of a growing body of research on resilience that seeks to determine the factors that influence how well a community recovers from any disruption. A 2017 study said there was no “common, agreed definition of community resilience.” But the researchers found general agreement that resilience involves community networks, communication, health, governance, preparedness and mental outlook.

The Argonne study counts the number of civic and social organizations in each county relative to population and the percentage of residents who adhere to a religion. Civic, social and religious groups are important during disasters because of the support they provide individuals and the social networks they build for spreading information and mobilizing resources, the study says.

Religious adherence was highest in Utah and in the central United States, from North Dakota and Minnesota to Texas and Louisiana. It was lowest in the Northeast and Northwest. Civic and social organizations were sparse throughout the country, with pockets of strength in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and southern Florida.

But many of the categories that researchers studied—including hospital capacity, health insurance coverage and vehicle ownership—are tied closely to wealth, which results in a huge geographic divide in the United States.

Rating each county on its overall resilience, the study shows that 89% of the lowest-rated counties are in the South. Georgia, Texas, Kentucky and Mississippi have particularly high numbers of counties with low resilience scores. Puerto Rico also has very low resilience.

“Wealth certainly correlates to being able to afford things like insurance and the ability to pull yourself up after a disaster and get a hotel room,” Pfeiffer said.

The study aims to help local emergency managers understand the challenges their communities face in responding to a disaster, and to help FEMA work with localities to improve their resilience, a FEMA spokeswoman said.

The study acknowledges shortcomings. Analyzing data at a county level can “mask pockets of communities or neighborhoods that have significant challenges to resilience, such as migrant communities,” Pfeiffer said.

The study also does not analyze county emergency response plans, which could compensate for weaknesses such as a lack of hospital capacity or low numbers of medical professionals.

A few county rankings are anomalous, particularly Manhattan’s rank as the 55th least-resilient county in the United States, just ahead of Claiborne County, Miss. Manhattan’s per-capita income of $111,386 is the highest in the United States—substantially higher than Claiborne County’s $13,095—and it has an enormous number of hospitals, medical professionals and other attributes that add to its resilience.

But Manhattan has famously low rates of home and vehicle ownership, a transient population, and a notoriously small number of vacant apartments, all of which make it less resilient.

The study was published in December and is being updated with recent Census Bureau data.

Everything’s cheaper in two Texas cities, according to a new analysis.

According to a study by the Council for Community and Economic Research, two cities in the Lone Star State ranked as the cheapest places to live in America.

The research — which looked at 257 cities over the first quarter of this year and analyzed the cost of housing, utilities, grocery items, transportation, health care, and miscellaneous goods and services — found that the Texas city of Harlingen was the cheapest place overall, followed by McAllen, Texas. (We previously looked at the most expensive.)

The South featured heavily on the least expensive list. And across the board, housing costs — as well as goods and services expenses — in these cities were much lower compared to the national average.

A mid ten consecutive weeks of protest in Hong Kong, Beijing is looking to a seemingly unlikely place for support: Europe. In recent days, Chinese ambassadors across the continent have gone on the offensive to rally Europe behind Hong Kong’s government and against the protestors. As part of their campaign to promote Beijing’s line, China’s ambassadors are publishing op-eds in local papers and publicly criticizing European leaders for failing to denounce what they are trying to frame as violent protests. The audacity of China’s efforts suggests that in Beijing’s eyes, Europe is up for grabs.

There’s a reason China thinks Europe might be persuaded. As China attempts to spread its authoritarian values across the globe, and especially as the competition between China and the United States intensifies, Europe has conspicuously avoided siding with the United States over China. European leaders remain convinced they can uphold the values and norms they share with Washington while benefitting economically from greater engagement with China. This stance is short-sighted and dangerous—putting liberal democracy in peril.

China is a close and important partner for Europe; the two sides trade roughly 1 billion Euros worth per day, and Chinese foreign direct investment in the EU totaled 29.1 and 17.3 billion Euros in 2017 and 2018 respectively. The economic opportunity that China presents—especially for countries that have lagged economically behind Western Europe—creates strong incentives to sit on the fence. Countries in Southern and Eastern Europe in particular benefit from China’s Belt and Road investment and are keen to avoid losing it.

At the EU-level, leaders have been unable to chart a clear course for dealing with China. Yes, some countries like Germany and France have driven progress on this front—the EU referred to Beijing as a “systemic rival” earlier this year, and the European Commission introduced a new framework to facilitate closer scrutiny of Chinese investments in Europe. But while EU-level joint statements and guidelines are welcome developments, implementation of the guidelines is left up to EU member states, who have different strategies to deal with China. As we have already seen, for example, some European leaders are willing to criticize China’s business practices and human rights record, while others have remained silent. This lack of cohesion prevents Europe from effectively countering the challenges that China’s rise creates or from clearly aligning with the Unites States in the ways that will be required to defend shared values.

Europe’s lack of a unified, strong approach largely stems from an absence of a European-wide consensus about the threat that China poses. Unlike Russia, which illegally annexed territory in Ukraine and regularly interferes in Europe’s democracies, China has pursued a more subtle approach to Europe. Moreover, while Russia looms large to Europe’s north, China is more distant and does not pose the same direct military threat. China’s tactics have so far obscured (or made it easier to overlook) the fact that, like Moscow, Beijing views liberal democracy as a threat to its success and stability and believes that by weakening democracy it can accelerate the decline of Western influence.

The United States has done little to help move Europe off the fence. Instead, the Trump administration has actively pushed the continent away. Withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear deal, imposing steel and aluminum tariffs, and antagonizing some of its closest allies, including by referring to the European Union a foe, have made the United States seem like a less attractive partner than it used to be. While Washington has been antagonistic, Beijing has been careful to strike all the right chords. The CCP talks about harmonizing civilizations, invokes “values” when discussing European and Chinese commonalities, and extols the values of multilateralism. Because China and Europe increasingly find themselves on the same side of conflicts with Washington, this administration has made it easy for Beijing to present itself as the reliable and responsible global player.

Europe’s reluctance to side with the United States puts liberal democracy in danger. The closer Europe gets to China, the less opposition China will face in its efforts to re-shape norms—on issues like data and privacy, Internet freedom, AI and governance. To uphold their shared values, both the United States and Europe need to collectively push back against China’s unfair trade and investment practices, its blatant human rights abuses, and the anti-democratic norms and practices it seeks to spread. A Europe that refuses to pick sides is exactly what Beijing seeks to achieve. Beijing understood long ago that its rising economic influence would lead other countries to balance against it. In an effort to dilute Western opposition to its national interests, China has taken steps to interrupt Europe’s alignment with the United States.

Choosing the United States does not mean that Europe should forfeit all trade and economic relations with China. But as Europe advances its economic relationships with China, it must be clear-eyed about the risks that accompany those ties. Beijing expects that its economic influence will translate into lasting diplomatic leverage in Europe. It will use its investment to secure support for—or at least prevent the EU from taking a unified position against—human rights issues like Tibet, the mass detention of Uighurs in “re-education” camps in Xinjiang, and on geopolitical issues like Taiwan and the militarization of the South China Sea.

China is already using its economic relationships to pressure Europe to acquiesce to its efforts to neuter democracy and human rights protections. For example, in 2017, Greece blocked an EU statement at the UN criticizing China’s human rights record. This was almost certainly because of China’s growing economic investment in the country. As long as Europe continues to sit on the fence, actions like these will only continue.

What would it look like for Europe to get off the fence? 5G is at the forefront of the debate. Europe should follow Japan, Australia and New Zealand’s example and ban high-risk vendors like Huawei from building its 5G infrastructure. Allowing China—which has a history of intellectual property theft, cyber espionage and the absence of an independent judiciary that allows the CCP to leverage Chinese companies for political gain—to play a foundational role in Europe’s 5G future would aid in Chinese espionage, jeopardize U.S.-European intelligence sharing and present novel threats of disruption or exploitation. Yet despite the risks, Huawei continues to expand its foothold in Europe’s 5G landscape. Countries including the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are allowing use of Huawei equipment on non-core parts of their networks.

Europe could also work with the United States to develop a joint response to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which serves as a conduit for China’s influence and tactics. Here Europe and the United States could develop common transparency, environmental and social standards, and pool their financial resources to jointly invest in those countries where their interests are most at stake. Similarly, Europe could work with Washington to better insulate supply chains against Chinese influence. Finally, Europe and the United States could develop a set of common rules for data privacy and artificial intelligence and vocally criticize China for its blatant human rights abuses. Progress on any of these fronts would be welcome. But at the heart of the matter, Europe must clearly communicate to Beijing that it will unequivocally side with America to uphold democratic norms and standards.

For certain, there has been a shift in European views on China. Europeans are more aware and concerned by the challenges that China poses and have taken real steps to push back against it. But the message coming from Europe continues to convey an aversion to choosing between the United States and China. Europe must realize where its long-term interests lie, and not let this administration or the allure of economic gains prevent the right choice. The health of liberal democracy will depend on it.

With less than 90 days left until the United Kingdom is set to leave the EU, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has staked his new premiership on a “do or die” Brexit by October 31. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Trade Secretary Liz Truss are crisscrossing North America as part of Downing Street’s latest push to shore up economic and political ties with key allies ahead of the looming withdrawal deadline. The United States will play a particularly important role for post-Brexit Britain regarding everything from trade to defense relations. Thus, London’s latest overtures to Washington are hugely significant for ensuring an orderly Brexit — deal or no deal.

Despite the importance of presidential–prime ministerial ties for the strength of Anglo–American relations, Congress remains the crucial player when it comes to any sort of free-trade agreement. Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the ability to regulate commerce with foreign countries, and both chambers of Congress must approve any trade agreement that the president has introduced.

Like much in Washington today, Congress remains divided on the possibility of a U.S.–U.K. free-trade deal, particularly over the question of Northern Ireland. Other concerns remain, including agricultural exports (such as the infamous chlorinated-chicken debate). However, fears over the return of a hard border in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit have risen to prominence in recent weeks. Currently, goods and people can travel seamlessly between the North and the Republic of Ireland. A hard border would in theory result in physical demarcation of the border, and the resulting customs and immigration checks could negatively impact the region’s economy.

The Congressional Friends of Ireland caucus remains a hugely influential presence on Capitol Hill. The lobby’s bipartisan contingent, from Republican Pete King (N.Y.) to Democratic Ways and Means Committee chairman Richard Neal (Mass.) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), have all made it clear that the House will reject any proposed U.S.–U.K. agreement that potentially jeopardizes the landmark Northern Irish peace settlement, the Good Friday Agreement (GFA), to which the U.S. is a party. Pelosi reiterated these concerns during an April visit to the Irish border and during a “reportedly stormy” meeting with pro-Brexit MPs in London.

In contrast to the House’s approach, Senator Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) and 44 other Republican senators recently penned a letter to the prime minister, voicing their commitment to intelligence sharing and trade relations, as well as “continued, unwavering support for the special relationship between our two countries as Britain leaves the European Union.”

The Irish border debate has similarly become a thorny issue for Britain. Theresa May’s government was unable three times to pass her EU Withdrawal Agreement over the objection of Brexiteer and Northern Irish MPs because of its provisions regarding the Irish backstop, which would lock Britain into a potentially indefinite relationship with the EU in order to maintain frictionless trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland/Britain. Significantly, the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party’s 10 MPs are the only way Boris Johnson can command a razor-thin one-seat majority in the House of Commons.

Regardless of whether Britain leaves the EU, and with or without a deal, peace across the island of Ireland and ongoing enforcement of the GFA remain essential. The PM recently made clear that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Britain will not enforce a hard border, border checks, or physical barriers; furthermore, he reiterated Britain’s commitment to the Union and the GFA, as well as a restoration of the devolved assembly in Belfast. The separatist Sinn Féin party, predictably, has called for a referendum on Irish reunification in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but no serious official thinks that no-deal could return Northern Ireland to The Troubles, the sectarian strife that plagued the region until the adoption of the GFA in 1998.

Unfortunately, Ireland and the EU have used the border question as a cudgel against London, insisting the backstop must stay in any withdrawal deal, and have used the specter of The Troubles to raise doubts even in Washington. Nevertheless, public support in Ireland for PM Leo Varadkar’s hardline Brexit stance has dropped dramatically, and senior officials in Dublin are similarly beginning to question his approach. Given this growing dissatisfaction and Ireland’s heavy economic ties to the U.K., the negative impact of a no-deal Brexit could force Varadkar and the EU’s hands over the backstop.

Ultimately, both Britain and the U.S. can take steps to allay some of the concerns over Northern Ireland and its role in trade negotiations. First, Britain’s new ambassador in Washington will have the ability to restructure the embassy’s operations in the U.S. The Irish embassy has been extremely influential on Capitol Hill, and the British should emulate Ireland’s impressive congressional engagement efforts to build enduring personal relationships with key members on the various armed-services, foreign-affairs, and trade-related committees. Along with frequent engagement by high-level British officials during visits to Washington, the embassy’s regular efforts to keep U.S. policymakers informed of goings-on in London could help reassure weary members of the U.K.’s commitment to the GFA and bolster Anglo–American legislative ties.

Second, since his appointment in 2017, U.S. ambassador to Great Britain Woody Johnson has been a strong advocate of U.S. interests in government circles across London and rural areas alike. The new British ambassador should take advantage of his/her new role and promote British interests across the U.S. Diplomacy should be more than just a heavy presence in Washington and New York. Frequent engagement across the country, from Phoenix to Philadelphia, can remind everyday Americans and government alike of Britain’s commitment to every facet of the special relationship.

Lastly, the position of U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland remains vacant. Leo Varadkar has already urged the president to make such an appointment, and an American presence in Belfast would be an important way to demonstrate the U.S’s ongoing commitment to the peace process as well as U.S.–Irish and U.S.–U.K. ties, regardless of the final outcome of Brexit.

Peace in Northern Ireland will remain essential after Britain leaves the EU. Boris Johnson’s government has reaffirmed its commitment to defending the Union and upholding the Good Friday Agreement. American policymakers should not fear instability in Ireland, but instead welcome the chance to craft a trade deal and strengthen both the trans-Atlantic economy and our ties with our most important ally.

As you’ve probably heard by now, Donald Trump doesn’t like undocumented immigrants, unless they’re working for low pay and no benefits at one of his golf clubs. Confronted by his barbaric policies and rhetoric, the president’s defenders like to claim that he’s only taking a hard line against the “undocumented” part of the equation, and that such people wouldn’t have to worry about being subject to his cruelty if only they would just follow the law. The president, they insist, has no problem whatsoever with immigrants in general, he just wants them to come to the U.S. legally. Of course, in reality, this is not the case at all. Trump has previously endorsed legislation that would sharply slash legal immigration by 50% over the next 10 years; gutted the U.S. refugee program; complained about why “all these people from shithole [African and Haitian] countries come here”; and expressed a desire to only accept people from distinctly rich, white countries. Unfortunately for the president, he can’t simply slap a sign on the Statue of Liberty that says “Only white people whose father gave them millions of dollars to squander allowed!” So, he’s developed a nifty work-around.

On Monday, a week after State Department data revealed that the number of Mexicans refused visas to the U.S. because they might use government benefits had “skyrocketed,” the administration announced that it is setting new standards for obtaining a green card and citizenship. While the likelihood of becoming a “public charge” is already taken in account when being considered for permanent residency, under the new rules, much more emphasis will be placed on wealth, plus education, age, and English-language skills. According to the new policy for “Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds,” which was published in the Federal Register Monday and will go into effect in two months, factors that can count against a green card applicant include not having the money to cover “any reasonably foreseeable medical costs” related to a medical condition; having been approved to receive a public benefit, even if the person never received the benefit; “financial liabilities”; a low credit score; the absence of private health insurance; the absence of a college degree; and not having the English language skills “sufficient to enter the job market.” Per the Washington Post, analysts say the change could “dramatically reduce family-based legal immigration to the United States, particularly from Latin America and Africa, where incomes are generally lower than the rest of the world.,” which we assume was not just a happy coincidence.

“With one regulation, they are attempting to scratch two itches: one is penalizing immigrants for using public benefits that they are legally entitled to, and the other is cutting legal immigration in half,” Doug Rand, a former Obama administration official and an immigration consultant, told reporters Abigail Hauslohner, Maria Sacchetti, Tracy Jan, and Nick Miroff, “And the way you cut legal immigration in half is by kicking the doors out from the definition of ‘likely to become a public charge.” According to immigration groups and New York mayor’s office—which has announced plans to sue the administration—just “the anticipation of” the new rule “already has prompted a large number of legal immigrants to abstain from seeking federal financial assistance because they are afraid it will hinder their ability to become citizens or remain in the United States.” So the whole thing is putting immigrants in a fun position of damned if they do, damned if they don’t wherein they can either receive the public assistance they’re legally entitled to, in order to say, eat, and risk being denied a green card, or forgo food in the hopes of being allowed to stay in the country.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the change was based in logic that would have precluded Trump from receiving a green card should he have been born in another country. “Trump’s administration is reinforcing the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful here in America.” Cuccinelli also tried to claim that the new rule has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with discriminating against poor people from Latin America:

Based on the most recent data, the bank’s global economist now sees a greater than 30% chance of a recession in the next year. “Our official model has the probability of a recession over the next 12 months only pegged at about 20%, but our subjective call based on the slew of data and events leads us to believe it is closer to a 1-in-3 chance,” Bank of America’s head of U.S. economics Michelle Meyer said in a note to clients Friday.

Uncertainty around the U.S.–China trade war and a global economic slowdown have caused interest rates to tumble and weighed on the major stock averages in recent weeks. Last month’s jobs report showed a strong consumer, but business investment is low as investors and business owners juggle new tariffs and fiscal policy uncertainty.

The U.S. fiscal deficit has already exceeded the full-year figure for last year, as spending growth outpaces revenue.

The gap grew to $866.8 billion in the first 10 months of the fiscal year, up 27% from the same period a year earlier, the Treasury Department said in its monthly budget report on Monday. That’s wider than last fiscal year’s shortfall of $779 billion -- which was the largest federal deficit since 2012.

So far in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, a revenue increase of 3% hasn’t kept pace with a 8% rise in spending. While still a modest source of income, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration helped almost double customs duties to $57 billion in the period.

Trump Signs Budget and Debt-Limit Legislation, White House Says

Republican tax cuts, increased federal spending and an aging population have contributed to the fiscal strains, though the GOP says tax reform enacted last year will spur economic growth and lift government revenue. Corporate income-tax receipts rose 3% between October and July, while individual income taxes gained 1%, according to Treasury data.

The annual budget deficit is expected to exceed $1 trillion starting in 2022, the Congressional Budget Office has said. The non-partisan agency is scheduled to update its latest 10-year budget and economic forecasts on Aug. 21.

For the month of July, the budget deficit was $119.7 billion, compared with $76.9 billion a year earlier, according to Treasury. Still, “July 2019 was a record receipts month, and the month is generally a deficit month -- 63 of the last 65 times,” a senior Treasury official said in an accompanying statement.

As the United States appears to be nearing a deal with the Taliban on pulling its troops from Afghanistan, the country’s security forces are in their worst state in years — almost completely on the defensive in much of the country, according to local military commanders and civilian officials.

Afghan commanders vowed last year to take the offensive, rather than go on fighting a static “checkpoint war.” But in most major battlegrounds, the bulk of the regular Afghan forces are still holed up in fortified bases and outposts. Most offensive operations have been left to small numbers of Afghan and U.S. Special Operations soldiers, backed by both countries’ air forces.

The woeful state of the regular Afghan forces has been widely seen as giving the Taliban a valuable edge in its negotiations with the United States, which have gone on for eight rounds in Doha, Qatar, and are believed to be near a conclusion. An announcement could come as early as Tuesday, but also may be delayed, perhaps for weeks.

An analysis of more than 2,300 combat deaths of government forces, compiled in daily casualty reports by The New York Times from January through July, found that more than 87% occurred during Taliban attacks on bases, checkpoints or command centers. These numbers indicate that the Taliban can attack many such bases almost at will.

During that seven-month period, the Taliban mounted more than 280 such attacks — an average of more than one a day.

“Police and soldiers are stuck in their bases,” said Abdul Aziz Beg, head of the district council in Badghis province in western Afghanistan. “The Taliban are killing security forces easily, but no one pays attention.”

Local government officials in several provinces said the only ground operations against the Taliban were being carried out by the U.S.-backed Afghan special forces.

“They come here, kill some people and arrest some, and that’s it. When they leave, the Taliban come back” and kill regular troops in their bases, said Rahmatullah Qaisari, a district governor in Faryab province in northern Afghanistan.

“To make people happy, security officials announce operations,” said Tor Khan Zarifi, a tribal elder in Herat province in the north. “These operations are kind of showoff — they don’t have any impact.”

A senior U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, acknowledged that the Afghans were increasingly relying on elite units such as commandos and special police units to attack the Taliban. He said regular Afghan units still sustained most of their casualties while trying to hold on to territory anchored by bases and checkpoints.

Dan Coats, the U.S. director of national intelligence, told Congress this year that outside urban areas, “Afghan security suffers from a large number of forces being tied down in defensive missions, mobility shortfalls and a lack of reliable forces to hold recaptured territory.”

Afghanistan’s minister of defense, Asadullah Khalid, said that since taking command in December he had worked to shift regular forces out of their defensive posture.

“Their mindset has changed from defensive to offensive,” Khalid said. “Let’s be clear: These bases are not for us to just stay there and sleep there. They are going out on the offense.”

But Khalid also said that some regular forces had sustained high casualty rates this year during Taliban attacks on checkpoints and bases, in areas where the militants were not threatened by government offensives.

“We are trying to reverse that situation,” he said.

Only about 3% of the 2,300 deaths in the casualty reports compiled by The Times this year occurred during offensive combat operations carried out by regular forces. Among those were troops killed in Taliban ambushes after being sent to reinforce besieged bases or checkpoints.

Roughly 10% of the deaths occurred in other actions, away from bases and checkpoints. They were attributed to roadside bombs; attacks on convoys; snipers; insider attacks; friendly fire; and ambushes of soldiers or police who were on food runs, driving to work, in their homes, in bazaars, at weddings, in mosques or in clinics.

The casualty reports are compiled daily by Times reporters across Afghanistan. They are based on interviews with local government and security officials, district council members, village elders, local members of parliament and other sources.

According to the Ministry of Defense’s own combat reports, roughly seven times as many offensive operations have been carried out by commandos as by regular security forces. And the number of Afghan Air Force strikes has typically been far higher than the number of operations by regular forces.

For July, the ministry reported 2,825 operations by commandos and 651 airstrikes, compared with 409 operations by regular forces. Khalid said that in many operations, commandos were backed by regular forces.

The ministry said the July operations had killed more than 2,400 insurgents. As of Aug. 7, nearly 4,800 insurgents had been killed this year, said Gen. Khoshal Sadat, a defense ministry official. Both sides routinely inflate enemy casualty reports.

The ministry reports do not mention government casualties. After May 2017, the Afghan military stopped releasing its casualty figures. The information has since been treated as classified by the U.S. military at the Afghans’ request.

By all accounts, Afghan security forces outnumber the insurgents. Yet the casualty numbers have been steadily rising among soldiers and police who were guarding bases and outposts, rather than engaged in actual battles.

On June 30, for instance, 58 members of the security forces were reported to have been killed in two separate Taliban attacks — on a military base in the southern province of Kandahar, and on two checkpoints in Kunduz province in the north.

Asked about those incidents, Khalid said the Taliban had suffered higher casualties than had government forces, and that they had failed to capture the base or the checkpoints.

Three weeks later, on July 25, the Taliban briefly overran two military bases in Takhar province in northern Afghanistan. Local officials said up to 37 troops were killed.

Increasingly, the only Afghan units truly on the offensive are special forces commandos, who often partner with U.S. Special Operations troops for combined ground and air operations.

“The weight of the Afghan war is mostly on the shoulders of commandos and the air force — they are doing all the offensive operations,” said Gharzai Khowakhozhai, a former army general and a military analyst in Kabul, the capital. “Regular forces are not doing their job properly.”

The letter comes as The New York Times reported over the weekend that the Times had interviewed more individuals who had corroborated the allegation of Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate who alleged Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her at a dorm room party. The Times also reported that there was another previously undisclosed allegation raised by Max Stier, a Yale classmate who told the Times that he had witnessed Kavanaugh engage in another, similar incident.

CNN is not reporting any details of the accusation and has not independently corroborated the account. The Times on Sunday evening published an Editor's Note to its original story saying the female victim declined to be interviewed, and her friends told the authors she does not recall the incident.

In a letter dated October 2, 2018, Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, sent a letter to the FBI requesting that the agency talk to individuals that had more information about Kavanaugh. Specifically, Coons suggested the FBI talk to Stier. It's unclear from the letter exactly what information Stier had, but Coons suggests the FBI talk to him. Stier's name in the letter is redacted in the version seen by CNN, but an aide for Coons told CNN that that the name was Stier's. Coons had copied then-Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and its top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California.

In the letter to the FBI, Coons wrote that his office had been contacted by numerous individuals who had information to share with the FBI as part of their investigation into Kavanaugh, and while he could not speak to "the relevancy or veracity of the information that many of these individuals seek to provide ... there is one individual whom I would like to specifically refer to you for appropriate follow up." The letter goes on to say the individual is "a Yale College classmate of Kavanaugh and Ramirez with information relevant to Ramirez's allegations."

An aide familiar with the letter told CNN that the FBI acknowledged receipt of Coons' letter at the time, but the senator never heard more beyond that.

According to a Republican source familiar with the letter, both Grassley and Feinstein were copied on the letter to the FBI from Coons. The source notes that Stier's contact information was in there but not any specific allegation. Additionally the source says Stier did not bring the allegation directly to Grassley.
A number of 2020 candidates demanded Kavanaugh's impeachment after the New York Times published excerpts of a new book containing details about sexual misconduct allegations that he has previously denied, but that revived the raw emotions spurred by his fight for confirmation last year.

"Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people," California Sen. Kamala Harris wrote Sunday morning on Twitter. "He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice."

The Democratic front-runner, Joe Biden, stopped short Sunday evening of calling for impeachment but raised concerns about the integrity of Kavanaugh's confirmation process.

Trump barged into the fray in Kavanaugh's defense, relishing the opening to revive one of the most emotional and GOP-unifying chapters of his presidency.

"Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable," Trump tweeted Sunday morning.

The eagerness of both sides to engage reflects the confrontation's potential to fire up base activists and an understanding that the fate of the Supreme Court has rarely been more important to the outcome of political and culture wars following signature decisions on the 2000 election, campaign finance, same sex marriage, abortion and health care.

The reports are reviving the pitched political exchanges that threatened Kavanaugh's confirmation, most notably over allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her when he was drunk at a party when both were teenagers. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the claims.

New scrutiny on confirmation process

Two Times reporters who wrote the book said they corroborated a prior claim of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. They also concluded the FBI interviewed none of the potential witnesses, throwing new scrutiny on White House officials and Republicans who strong armed his confirmation last year.

The book also contains a former male classmate's new allegation that the authors say was corroborated by two sources. The authors reported the former classmate came forward to the FBI and senators concerning an incident he witnessed and said the FBI did not investigate the claim.

The New York Times Sunday evening published an Editor's Note saying the female victim declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the incident.

A person close to Kavanaugh told CNN the accusation isn't new because, according to the book's authors, it had been reported to the FBI and some on Capitol Hill. This person said, citing the new book, that some Democratic senators, despite having been told of the allegations before Kavanaugh was confirmed, did not act.

CNN is not reporting any details related to the allegation because it has not independently verified it.

A Supreme Court spokeswoman said Kavanaugh had no comment on the new allegation against the justice or the calls for impeachment.

'This is the game they play'

Far from playing down the fresh controversy to allow Kavanaugh to quietly repair his reputation and embark quietly on his lifetime appointment to the Court, Trump escalated it.

The President must supercharge GOP turnout to win in 2020, so is happy to exploit the latest Kavanaugh controversy to remind his base of one of his key achievements, the installation of a conservative majority on the Supreme Court against fierce liberal opposition.

The clash plays into his desire to frame Democrats as entrapped by radicals who want to march the country left and who he claims are smearing the reputation of an innocent man in their desperation to thwart conservative goals. Trump also is keen to position himself as a bulwark against Democratic hopes of reshaping the Court in order to appeal to crucial evangelical voters.

"Can't let Brett Kavanaugh give Radical Left Democrat (Liberal Plus) Opinions based on threats of Impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?), false allegations, and lies.

"This is the game they play. Fake and Corrupt News is working overtime! #ProtectKavanaugh" Trump tweeted.

A new skirmish over a potent base politics issue comes at an ideal moment for Trump, whose approval rating has recently dipped below 40% — a danger sign ahead of a reelection bid.

Trump demanded that his Justice Department "rescue" Kavanaugh, and advised the judge to sue over the book. He also accused Democrats of trying to influence the rulings of the newest justice, an ironic comment given his own relentless habit of publicly attacking judges and complaining about their verdicts.

His remark about the Justice Department also calls to mind previous occasions when the President has appeared to seek to leverage its power to counter political opponents.

Trump's foes were already up in arms over the department's role in the Kavanaugh drama after it emerged Friday that Attorney General William Barr plans to confer a distinguished service award on the department team that worked on the nomination.

Reflecting the unifying nature of Supreme Court controversies, Mitch McConnell also came to Kavanaugh's defense on Sunday. The Senate Majority leader's expert and controversial handling of nominations to the top bench has done more than any other single factor to enshrine a conservative majority.

"The far left's willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year's confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate," the Kentucky Republican wrote on Twitter.

"Fortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence. I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh."

Democrats playing catch-up over Supreme Court politics

Kavanaugh's confirmation was especially inflammatory because it took place against a backdrop of the #MeToo movement that fundamentally altered the attention society paid to decades of sexual harassment allegations made by women in show business, politics, journalism, the media and the corporate world.

Combined with anger over the defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump — which he has denied — the Kavanaugh saga electrified the liberal base but also a wider cohort of women voters who will be pivotal in 2020.

While Republicans have used the Supreme Court as a campaign trail rallying cry for years, Democrats have been slower to exploit what has become a pivotal societal question.

But the aggressive response to the new Kavanaugh allegations demonstrates that the left is now just as motivated by the Supreme Court as conservative voters.

As the New York Times report broke Saturday night, Democratic candidate Julián Castro tweeted that it was clearer than ever that Kavanaugh "lied under oath. He should be impeached."

The former Housing and Urban Development Secretary called on Congress to review the "failure" of the Justice Department to properly investigate allegations against Kavanaugh.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Texas Rep Beto O'Rourke and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg all called for Kavanaugh's impeachment.

Later Sunday, Harris urged supporters to sign a petition calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment. Warren complained that Kavanaugh's confirmation was pushed through the Senate without a full investigation of allegations against him.

"Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached," she tweeted.

Biden did not call for impeachment but said in a statement that the New York Times story raised "profoundly troubling questions about the integrity of the confirmation process that put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court in the first place."

And the former vice president, who has been criticized in this campaign for his handling in 1991 as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman of confirmation hearings in which Anita Hill raised sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas, said women who raise allegations against powerful men need to be heard.

"It takes enormous courage for a woman to come forward, under the bright lights of millions of people watching, and relive a traumatic memory," he said.

In practice, there is a minuscule chance that Kavanaugh would be convicted of any impeachment charges brought by the Democratic House, given the need for a two-thirds majority in the Republican-held Senate.
The excerpt from "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation," written by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, revisits an allegation raised during the Supreme Court justice's confirmation process in 2018. That allegation from Deborah Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a party when he was a freshman at Yale, according to an account published in The New Yorker. Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegation.

The book revisits Ramirez's claim and contains a former male classmate's new allegation which the authors say was corroborated by two sources. The authors reported the former classmate came forward to the FBI and senators concerning an incident he witnessed and said the FBI did not investigate the incident.

The New York Times Sunday evening published an Editor's Note saying the female victim declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the incident.

A person close to Kavanaugh told CNN the accusation isn't new because, according to the book's authors, it had previously been reported to the FBI and some on Capitol Hill. This person said, citing the new book, that some Democratic senators, despite having been told of the allegations before Kavanaugh was confirmed, did not act.

CNN is not reporting any details related to the allegation because CNN has not independently verified it.

Trump tweeted Sunday that Kavanaugh "should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue." (The President initially misspelled the word "libel" before deleting the tweet and correcting the word in a subsequent tweet.)

In nominating Kavanaugh, Trump seized a rare opportunity to solidify a conservative majority for a generation on the Supreme Court. The President and those who worked to get him on the bench are now waiting to see if their calculation was correct, and for a sense of how far and how fast the conservative majority will move.

A Supreme Court spokeswoman said Kavanuagh had no comment on the new allegation against the justice or the calls for impeachment.

The President's pick for the Supreme Court faced allegations of sexual misconduct that threatened to derail his confirmation in 2018.

Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor and the first accuser to come forward, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party when they were both teenagers. He has also denied that allegation.

Trump at the time sought to discredit Ford and Ramirez, and said Kavanaugh was "under assault." He mocked and imitated Ford at a campaign rally, and accused Democrats of masterminding "a con game" against his Supreme Court nominee.

Conservatives throughout the controversy largely stood by Kavanaugh, who was confirmed in October to take former Justice Anthony Kennedy's seat after the vicious approval battle and a 50-48 Senate vote.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted Sunday he looks forward "to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh."

"Fortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence," McConnell wrote.

2020 Democrats respond

Several Democratic presidential candidates were quick to weigh in Sunday, with some calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment from the high court.

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted Kavanaugh should be impeached.

"I sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people," Harris wrote. "He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice."

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro also called for Kavanaugh's impeachment and for an investigation into the latest allegation. "Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter," Castro said.

In a separate tweet, Castro fired back at Trump's Sunday Kavanaugh comments. "The Department of Justice isn't your law firm, or Brett Kavanaugh's. Even if (Attorney General) Bill Barr acts like your lawyer," Castro said in reference to Trump's tweet defending the Supreme Court justice.

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, also a member of the Judiciary Committee, told ABC's "This Week" on Sunday she strongly opposed Kavanaugh's confirmation, and accused Barr of "shielding documents" related to the allegations against Kavanaugh.

"I strongly opposed him, based on his views on executive power, which will continue to haunt our country, as well as how he behaved, including the allegations that we are hearing more about today," Klobuchar told ABC.

Klobuchar said the "process was a sham" and added, "I don't think that you can look at impeachment hearings without getting the documents -- the House would have to get the documents -- and the Attorney General is shielding documents." She said all of the relevant information needs to come forward before considering an impeachment process against Kavanaugh.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called the new revelations "disturbing," saying on Twitter, "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote on Twitter, "The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable."

Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke tweeted, "Yesterday, we learned of another accusation against Brett Kavanaugh — one we didn't find out about before he was confirmed because the Senate forced the F.B.I. to rush its investigation to save his nomination. We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached."

South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg called on Kavanaugh to resign and said, "if he doesn't, the House should impeach him."

Former Vice President Joe Biden did not call for Kavanaugh's impeachment Sunday, saying "We must follow the evidence to wherever it leads."

"Doing this the right way is critically important in getting the truth and restoring the American people's faith in their government," Biden added. "The women who continue to come forward, as Dr. Blasey Ford courageously did, deserve to be treated with dignity and be listened to. It takes enormous courage for a woman to come forward, under the bright lights of millions of people watching, and relive a traumatic memory."
The Trump administration upgraded the incident into a global crisis with its swift move to directly blame Iran for the coordinated drone strike. The strike was claimed by Houthi rebels that Tehran supports in Yemen.

The President's comments sparked immediate uncertainty over whether he was being serious or whether this tension-raising tweet was -- like a similar warning once aimed at North Korea -- a risky negotiating tactic.

It is unclear whether his "locked and loaded" phraseology threatens military force against Iran, its proxies in Iraq or Yemen or some kind of US response that stops short of retaliatory attacks.

In fresh sign of the administration's incoherent messaging on a war-or-peace issue, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short appeared to try to draw the US back from the brink on Monday morning.

"I think that 'locked and loaded' is a broad term and talks about the realities that we're all far safer and more secure domestically from energy independence," he told reporters.

But Trump's aggressive response already has raised the possibility that the US could become embroiled in a military confrontation between two bitter regional rivals that could quickly spin out of control.

The latest developments also underscore that even without recently departed Iran hawk John Bolton in the White House, the path of US Iran policy perpetually courts the risk of a dangerous escalation.

They also highlight the head-spinning nature of Trump's foreign policy. The President had recently seemed to be trying to set up a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani as he goes in pursuit of big wins abroad to boost his reelection bid. Now, he's apparently threatening war.

"There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!" Trump tweeted on Sunday.

Confusion about Trump's intentions at a time of flaring tensions with Iran was compounded by another of his tweets on Monday morning that appeared to downplay the effect of the oil refinery attack on US interests.

"We are a net Energy Exporter, & now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We don't need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies!"

That tweet bolstered a growing impression that US foreign policy at any moment depends on Trump's whiplash mood reflected by his often contradictory tweets, a culture of inconsistency that US adversaries may now be exploiting.

On Sunday, for instance, Trump claimed reports that he had agreed to meet Rouhani with "no conditions" was incorrect. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday the President "has said he would sit down with Rouhani with no conditions."

Risks of war

If he was intending to rattle Iran but not signal military action, Trump's brinkmanship will spark fresh fears that his hyper personal approach could inadvertently drag the US into a conflict that could quickly escalate with unpredictable, damaging consequences in the Middle East and beyond.

US officials Sunday pointed to satellite imagery provided to CNN showing the oil facilities were struck from the northwest, suggesting an attack from Iraq, where Tehran has proxies or Iran, among other information. Tehran has denied any involvement.

But if the attack was the work of Iran there will be speculation that Tehran has concluded that the President's previous unwillingness to back up his rhetoric with military force during a previous confrontation in July and the departure of Bolton, means Washington is unlikely to respond to any provocation.

That would set up a classic scenario whereby misunderstood signals and careless escalations can drag two adversaries into a conflict neither really wants.

The implication meanwhile that the President was awaiting a go ahead from Saudi Arabia also opened him up to accusations he was outsourcing US military action to a foreign power.

It also highlighted how his hardline anti-Iran policy has put all US chips on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who is seen by many Washington foreign policy experts as aggressive and unpredictable and presiding over an ill-advised war in Yemen that has ignited a devastating humanitarian crisis.

So far, the United States, for all its tough talk, has not provided any proof that Iran was directly behind an attack whose sophistication raised suspicions it was beyond the Houthis.

Given the President's propensity to peddle untruths, the burden of truth for any military strike would be high -- even higher than it would have been given that inaccurate intelligence led the US into its last major war in the Middle East, in Iraq.

Questions about Iran's calculations

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo first raised the stakes over the strike at the Saudi oil facility on Saturday.

"Tehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen," Pompeo wrote.

His unequivocal declaration all but boxed the United States into a strong response to the attack, possibly involving some kind of military action.

Yet it also begs the question whether the President is fully on board with his own secretary of state who is now wielding even more power over US foreign policy with Bolton gone.

Trump said he decided in June to pull back a military strike against Iran at the last moment because it would have killed many civilians and was not proportionate to avenge the downing of a US drone over the Gulf of Oman by the Islamic Republic.

There were subsequent reports that he complained that his aides were trying to goad him into a war with Iran that could contradict his campaign vow to avoid new Middle East entanglement.

If Iran or an Iranian proxy does turn out to be behind an attack that sent global oil prices soaring, there will be questions about the Islamic Republic's motivation and how it is calculating its response to Trump's policies.

The developments could suggest Iran has no intention of responding to any US overtures, following Trump's decision to pull out of the nuclear deal forged by his predecessor Barack Obama and the adoption of a "maximum pressure" sanctions campaign.

Iranian politics are notoriously difficult to judge from the outside. But the crisis could also indicate that factions in the Islamic Republic are seeking to squelch any political maneuvering room for any leaders who are open to talking to the US.

Rouhani did not specifically reference the attack on the Saudi facility in an address on Iran's Press TV Sunday but did accuse Americans of running a "war operation" by supporting the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

On Monday, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that a meeting between Trump and Rouhani at the UN General Assembly in New York next week was not on the agenda but didn't directly rule it out.

Recent developments would seem to close Trump's latitude for a meeting. But the President cares little for convention and would love to spring a surprise.

A U.S. intelligence official alarmed by President Trump’s communications with a foreign leader filed an official whistleblower complaint last month with the inspector general for the intelligence community, the Washington Post reports.
Trump’s interactions with the leader, whose identity has not been disclosed, included what the Post described as “a promise” the official “regarded as so troubling” that the official came forward.
It’s not clear what form the interaction took place, though one intelligence official told the Post that it was a phone call.
Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson found the complaint, which was filed on Aug. 12, to be credible and designated the matter of “urgent concern,” a legal classification that is supposed to prompt the notification of oversight committees in Congress.
Acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire, however, has so far refused to share the whistleblower’s concerns with Congress, setting off yet another power struggle between congressional leaders and the Trump administration, as well as speculation over what leader Trump may have acted inappropriately with.
The New York Times reporters behind the controversial piece about Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh claimed on Wednesday night that he had agreed to be interviewed for their book under the condition that they write that they didn't speak with him.

Appearing at a National Press Club event in Washington D.C., Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, the co-authors of the new book "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation," said Kavanaugh was willing to sit down with the them, but ultimately fell through because of his demand.

"Brett Kavanaugh agreed to talk to @katekelly and @rpogrebin for their book - If they wrote that they didn't talk to him," National Press Club president Allison Kodjak tweeted.
"The authors - who told the story tonight @PressClubDC, refused and walked away from the interview."
On Monday, Pogrebin and Kelly claimed that the key information missing from their piece was in the original draft and suggested that the editors removed it.

"In your draft of the article, did it include those words that have since been added to the article?" MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell asked.

"It did," both Pogrebin and Kelly responded.

"So somewhere in the editing process, those words were trimmed," O'Donnell said in clarification.

Pogrebin then explained that The Times doesn't usually include names of victims and that she believed that when the editors removed the name, the crucial information that she didn't remember was also removed.

"So I think it was just sort of an editing, you know, done in the haste in the editing process," Pogrebin added.

The National Weather Service in Honolulu tweeted: "***NO TSUNAMI THREAT*** We have received phone calls about sirens going off across Oahu, but we have confirmed with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center that there is NO TSUNAMI THREAT."
"Mahalo to everyone for taking appropriate action & tuning into local media," he tweeted, adding that the sirens had been "inadvertently triggered" during Honolulu Police Department training.
The incident reminded residents of a heart-stopping January 13, 2018 false warning of a ballistic missile attack which occurred amid especially bellicose rhetoric between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Just days before the mistaken alert, Kim had warned that the nuclear button is "always on my desk" and Trump retorted with a tweet: "I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!"
"I am pleased to announce that I will name Robert C. O'Brien, currently serving as the very successful Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, as our new National Security Advisor.
Trump personally dispatched O'Brien to help free US rapper A$AP Rocky from Swedish prison earlier this year.
Introducing O'Brien to reporters on the tarmac of Los Angeles International Airport, Trump hailed his "tremendous track record" securing the release of hostages and said "we know each other well," adding "Robert's been fantastic" as a hostage negotiator and that the US hasn't spent any money to secure the hostages' release.
"Robert O'Brien said, 'Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator in history.'

One of the first adages I heard as a tech reporter is a three-word refrain uttered by anyone who’s ever sought to make something with atoms rather than bits: Hardware is hard. Make a mistake in software and you can push out a fix more or less immediately; make a mistake with hardware and the phones explode. In the old days, a tech company typically made software or hardware, but these days that or has been replaced with an and. After Apple’s outsized success with the iPhone, all the other tech giants got religion on the value of software and hardware working together. And suddenly companies like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, who once limited themselves to high-margin software businesses, had to invest untold billions in figuring out to make and sell physical objects.

Facebook first dipped a toe in these waters when it bought Oculus, maker of virtual reality hardware, in 2014. Since then, as Salvador Rodriguez recounts in CNBC today, the company has struggled to gain traction in hardware markets. It spun up a research and development lab called Building 8 in 2016, making sci-fi promises about technologies that would let us hear with our skin and type with our minds. But Building 8 was reorganized into nonexistence just two years later — with its only lasting contribution to Facebook’s product lineup being the video-chat device Portal.

Portal launched last year to a tech press skeptical that consumers would welcome into their homes a camera and microphone from a company that has spent the past few years battered by data privacy scandals.
At the same time, it can take a brand years to build market share. There was never a question in my mind whether Facebook would build a second generation of Portal devices — only what they would look like when they arrived, and how the world would react when they did.

On Wednesday we found out. The company introduced three new version of Portal: an 8-inch and a 10-inch version that look like less functional iPads, and an accessory called Portal TV that plugs into your television. As before, a major theme of coverage was the privacy risks associated with the device.
Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, the longtime Facebook executive who now runs the hardware division, says Portal is a quintessential Facebook product. “This product is the very core essence of what Facebook does,” he said Tuesday at a product demonstration I attended in San Francisco. “It connects you meaningfully with the people you care most about.”

The way it connects people is largely through video calls, which it spiffs up with augmented reality features, a camera that tracks people around the room, and other enhancements. To me it all feels like a lot of work to make video calls marginally better, but Bosworth told me that Portal is something different.

“Video calling on the phone always felt very transactional,” he told me. “Your left hand is sacrificed to the call until you’re done. [You’d think] ‘how can I get off this call as politely as possible? Whereas Portal is a lot more like hanging out. You don’t have to be doing anything. That, I think, is something that is interesting.”

Sure, I said. But why not just buy an iPad and use Skype or FaceTime?

“Right now those are not good experiences,” Bosworth said. “Go set an iPad up and spend a ton of time video-calling people you care about. See how enjoyable it, is or how annoying it is. And then do it with Portal.

“This is where I think people go wrong,” he continued. “People just look at the features on the box … That’s not there this lives. This lives in the experience.”

It remains to be seen how many more people will sign up for that experience than did last year. In the meantime, it’s clear that the story over privacy and in-home displays doesn’t begin and end with Facebook. On the same day news of Portal came out, the Washington Post reported on how your smart TV is monitoring what you watch to target ads at you, and the Financial Times reported that your smart TV is sending market research data to Netflix and personally identifying information to Google.
A couple follow-up notes from yesterday’s column about Facebook’s forthcoming judicial branch. One, I’m told that the current working name is the “oversight board,” rather than the “independent oversight board,” even though that language was in yesterday’s blog post. The board will eventually be able to amend its bylines to change the name if it wants, Facebook told me.

Of more consequence: Evelyn Douek has a good post at Lawfare in which she explores how a recent update to Facebook’s values could affect how the board ultimately makes its decisions.
Therefore, in cases of ambiguity, when the extent of risk posed by a certain category of speech is not necessarily clear, Facebook will not—and, if the Oversight Board project works, cannot—err on the side of caution and simply take that content down “just in case.” This reflects a certain degree of risk tolerance on Facebook’s part—which will no doubt be praised by those committed to a robust marketplace of ideas. It also perhaps reflects the changing role of these private companies that facilitate so much public discourse: They are not literally, technically or legally a new public square, but their systemic importance means that society is coming to have expectations of their responsibility to the public that go beyond mere consumer satisfaction.
The Oversight Board is fundamentally a bet by Facebook that the legitimacy of its decisions matters—and matters more than getting its way on every question. As other platforms seem to double down on the idea that they do not need to publicly explain their decisions or abide by their own rules when it does not suit their short-term interests, Facebook appears to be making a different wager: Accountability and legitimacy can reassure users—and regulators—of the value of its product. Acting in bad faith would undermine Facebook’s own gamble. Legitimacy, Facebook hopes, will become part of its value proposition.

Guy #1: No; he could totally nail those two chicks.

Dad: Could you tell me where the auditorium is?
Security guy: It's on the second floor.
Dad: Wait, you mean it's actually in the building?

Girl: But, I mean, it's not like I ever plan on giving birth.

Hobo: Excuse me, this is a picture of my daughter Sofiya, she was in a fire recently and now she is brain damage can you spare some change so that we can give her a proper funeral? Anything will help, even a penny.
Man: Wait a minute! Is this the same daughter that was in a fire last summer? You mean to tell me you haven't buried her yet?

Guy: How old are you?
Hipster girl: You know, I never answer that question. Because to me, it's about how mature you are, you know? I mean, a fourteen year old could be more mature than a twenty-five year old, right? I'm sorry, I just never answer that question.
Guy: But, uh, you're older than eighteen, right?
Hipster girl: Oh, yeah.

Queer #1: What should I get? I'll have a falafel. Ha, ha!
Queer #2: I'll have one of these lamb slices.

Pizza guy: That's eggplant.

Guy #2: Or something.
Guy #1: Think about it: I loved Lemony Snicket, Party of Five , Diff'rent Strokes , Star Wars .
Guy #2: Yeah. Wait. Luke wasn't an orphan.
Guy #1: Well, he sort of was, spiritually.

Guy: I could be fired for 8 counts of sexual harassment last night.
Girl: Yeah, and that's just on me alone.

Asian girl: I really like sleep sex.
White girl #1: What's that?

Guy #1: But bitches are crazy, they will call the cops on you now. They will slap themselves in the face and when the cops show up they will point at you.
Guy #2: Fo' sho'.
Guy #1: That is why I ain't got no kids. I don't want a bunch of my seed running around and people calling me a scumbag because I don't take care of my kids. Bitch will turn on you for that child support.
Guys #2: I know my girl ain't gonna be doing that because she know I'm only making minimum wage.

Woman: I remember kindergarten. I got lots of candy and everyone wanted to play with me and I used to wet the bed a lot.
Man: You used to what?
Woman: I used to wet the bed. So they decided to move my bed farther away from the bathroom.

Tween girl #1: I'm gonna call that number 1-800-DIVORCE. I want to divorce my parents.
Tween boy: You can't divorce your parents, stupid. Can you marry your parents? No!
Tween girl #1: Technically, technically you can but that's just sick.
Tween girl #2: You're not really divorcing your parents. It's more like they giving up they rights.

Woman: Our biggest problem with sex was that he came too fast, because he was so into me. So now he uses desensitizing condoms, and that works a lot better, especially because it takes me a really long time to have an orgasm with him.
Woman: I was really anxious, so I went to my GP and she prescribed Klonopin. That completely took my anxiety away, but then my doctor said that she didn't feel that that was a good long-term drug.

Shopgirl #1: I can't believe she's in love with a guy who's 26.
Shopgirl #2: Well, my dad couldn't say anything if I went out with a guy who's 28 even, 'cause he married someone like 20 years younger than him.
Shopgirl #1: Wow, is she a hottie?
Shopgirl #2: She's a lawyer, so she can't be.

Man on cell: She gave him an iPod. Can you believe it? It's like, just not cool for a to give a an iPod. A guy can give a girl an iPod. But it shouldn't happen the other way around. It's just not right.
Southern woman #1: We're going to 8th Avenue, right?
Queer: Uh.
Southern woman #1: To Bergduff Goodman's. I bet you would usually be listening to your iPod on the subway instead of talking to a group of pretty women.
Queer: I like, never go above 14th Street. I stay within a five block radius of my apartment.
Southern woman #2: I read about that store before. Maybe I'll buy some blang to go with my new bag. I can wear it tonight when we go to the production.

Guy: I know a lot of people who hate the brontosaurus stampede because they think it's too, you know, fake.
Woman: I think Die Fledermaus the bat!
Man on cell: Because crows don't live in Antarctica...No, they don't !

Guy: I don't want to visit my miserable family unless it's for a funeral.

Woman: Sorry it took me so long; I had to move. That lady smelled. Like an old person. She smelled like my grandmother right before she died.
Girl on cell: Yeah, I could never be a dead person...unless I was actually dead, I guess...
Tourist mom: Do not touch any of these people; they'll pull out a gun and shoot you.

Store lady: You get in trouble for doing your job, you get in trouble
for not doing your job...
Suit: So I told him, "You might not be working on the work that you've been working on, but you're definitely going to be working on work."
Black guy: I would never leave anything to anyone not in my life. Anything I make, I leave to my wife--I'm not married yet--but I'd leave everything to my wife and my kids. I don't got much right now, but I got a plan. Anyone who's not successful, it's because they don't have a plan. If you don't have a plan, you'll fall down. Bill Gates, Donald Trump, those guys have their own airplanes and helicopters because they had a plan. That's what I'm working on now. In a few years, I'll be like them. I'm trying to get my own airplanes and helicopters and shit. And I'm going to leave 'em to my wife and kids.

Suit: When I was a kid, the joke was, "Mom, Dad, would you please split up, because I can get more money for college if I come from a broken home?".

Girl #1: Can you believe her? It drives me nuts!
Girl #2: Do you remember back when you were 17? You were just as bad.

Girl #2: You were the most conceited person I knew.
Girl #1: Was not. And what the fuck do you have to bring that up and throw it in my face for? God...Forget it, I am not helping you with your Green Card.

Store guy #2: Wait, Billy Corgan's dead?

Chick #1: And I was like, , it's food...I can it, you know?

January 31st sees the release of Overheard in New York , the book. There are apparently people out there who have lives and don't read websites; now they can see for themselves what this site we all love so much is all about.
The book is perfect subway reading, and makes a great gift for Chicks, Dudes, Old ladies, Tourist moms and Crazy guys. And unlike
almost every other website turned into a book, we weren't censored. You get the best of the best--and the worst of the worst!--as well as a bunch of quotes we saved especially for the print edition.
We're very excited and hope to make this an annual tradition. It'll be
like Zagat's, but with hobos. You can order it here .

Tween girl #1: No, I think they give us next year's 7th grade test, so we wouldn't know the answers.

Cashier girl: You have more than 10 items.
White man: Who are you? Are you the items police?
Cashier girl: You're only allowed to have 10 items.

Hobo: Hey man, this ain't a unionized situation.

Girl: Oh god! That woman stinks of garlic.
Guy #1: What, the one picking her nose?
Guy #2: Maybe she's trying to dislodge a clove of it or something...

Guy #1: You know what we need? A nice breeze.
Guy #2: What the fuck are you talking about? It's cold as balls.
Guy #1: I was being ironic.
Guy #2: That's not ironic. Ironic is like...shit, I don't know. Like that song.
Guy #1: Naw, man. That's what people think, but ironic is when you say some shit but you mean some other shit.
Guy #2: Motherfucker, that's facetious.
Guy #1: Yeah...Then what's ironic?
Guy #2: How the fuck should I know? You the nigga with the GED.

Hipster girl: I still don't understand why they say "word."
Hipster guy: Well, I think it's because they don't know what word to use. Like, they get so excited they can't say anything else.
Hipster girl: Why don't they just say like, "Wow, that's awesome" or something?
Hipster guy: That just makes you sound like an idiot.

Little boy: Dad, why did his legs pop up like that?
Dad: Rigor mortis, son. Rigor mortis.

Mom: Excuse me, Mr. Chocolate Chocolate Chip Muffin, that's a little revisionist, don't you think?

Mailwoman: Give me some of the cheese. No, not that, the American...the Americano...the yellow stuff. I don't worry about no gym so you can put more than that on. You're skinny, I'm fat. I can tell you don't love that cheese.
Woman: You know, I can make a pork chop taste like chicken.
Flyer guy: Hey, you want a coupon for a Spicy Chicken? It comes with free fries! You know you want free fries! Hey, smile, it's good for your aura!
Slavic girl: I cannot stand Americans who come to the opera smelling like hamburgers.
Teen girl: Oh my god. It so smells like fucking chocolate in here.
Girl: Health issues and drama at school and home. It's like a pizza pie of misery.
Woman on cell: Jesus Christ, this is like Russia in the 19th century only instead of toilet paper and soap, people are lined up to buy brie and pate.
Man on cell: I was just hoping they would let me eat it while I got a lap dance.
Girl: We're moving on to outer space--which is, metaphorically, cheese.
Lady: Oh yeah, I remember when my hair used to smell like special sauce.

Guy on cell: I don't think it's time yet to do the professional intervention thing. I mean if she drops down below 90, then maybe it's time. But I'd like to her get down to 95, then she would be hot. As long as she doesn't lose those 5 in her tits. Shit, she has nice tits.

Teen boy: Yo, Zach, I thought of a new Michael J. Fox joke. So, you go into a Verizon and start shaking and they go, "Who do you think you are? Superman?" and you say, "No", 'cause you're Michael J. Fox...'cause he has Parkinson's.
Pretty boy: All right! Fine! So I gave you herpes! Now we have herpes!

Girl: I coughed it up and everything was better.
Model guy: ...I know, jaundice is so in now.

Nurse woman: I used to catheterize people all the time, and I mean . . . Tons and tons of times.

Guy: You know, for a hundred dollars, you can get that old mink stole
made into a teddy bear!

Dude: Yo, I hate it when guys like, ride the train without their shirt on and stuff. It's nasty.
Guy: You can put sneakers in the oven, but that don't make them biscuits.
Queer: ...and he stretched, but he was obviously doing it so his shirt would ride up so he could show off how much weight he'd lost, and I was like, "Ugh, that's not coming anywhere near area."
Dude: People react differently to me in a suit. It's like they sense that it's who I really am.
Girl: Let me look. I'm, like, the Sherlock Holmes of underwear.
Woman: Then the models come in on drugs, still in their outfits, vomiting everywhere, and people are yelling, " What did they take ?" That's what my Fashion Week is like.
Old man on cell: Hi. What? Are you in stupid mode?...You're having a senior moment?...I wanna go see that underwear.
Hipster girl: American Apparel makes me want to fucking kill myself.
Old man: Are they nice ties? Yes! Are they the nicest ties I have ever seen? No! Let's go!
Chick: No, seriously, look at her legs. It's beyond cottage cheese thighs. Her whole legs are cottage cheese. It looks like she poured herself into her pantyhose.
Store guy: I have been a bartender and a waiter but I have never been the host. There is no way to estimate how long it will take to fit someone's breast into a bra. This is an art, not a science, people!
Security guy: I'm surprise I haven't seen nobody wearing shorts.
Woman: You know, there is something to be said for dressing seasonally. Seasonably? Whatever. I mean, it's cool if you want to wear a tube top to the bar or whatever, but when girls are going out in these little tube tops, wear a jacket! You know? No outfit is cool unless you're comfortable in it. To a degree.
Crazy guy: I'm poor! I'm poor! I'm poor! I'm poor! Won't somebody please buy me a pair of dungarees? I really need some dungarees.
Guy: Damn, girl! You look like either a nurse or a maid! I can't tell if you're serving drinks or starting an IV!

Jamaican woman: Oh mahn, I used to get so high and den turn on dat Spanish channel so loud and just sit in front of it and listen.

Old lady on cell: Forest View rehab !

Businessman lady on cell: And I was like, "Hello! I was totally a speed freak in college; I think I can handle TheraFlu Day!"
Hippie man: I am so glad we do drugs.
Professor guy: But I took ecstasy by accident, I was 43 years old. It's kind of harmless; it's cute, it's got a butterfly on it.

Old lady: No, Henry, trust me. You were never a fuck machine, and I certainly did know how to fake it.

Dude: Yo, I'm tired of this shit. I ain't fuckin' no girl behind no nigga's back....at least not that I know of.
Guy: But you were disappointed that you didn't get molested. Admit it...Oh my god, that was a joke! God, you are sexually repressed!
Dude: I just, like, lost my virginity three times in that pillow fight.
Guy on cell: So is this like a regular orgy, or do I need to bring a sleeping bag?
Dude: Is that fucking Ted? Under her? In the same fucking position we left him in three hours ago?
White chick: You gotta get to know me before you find out I'm a slut.
Guy: I feel bad for her, because what if she really isn't a slut? What if she's just, you know, empowered?
Businesslady on cell: Crazy monkey sex?
Teen girl: So then his mom walks in and I swear to God he's buttnaked from like the waist down, so he grabs this pillow. And she looks over to the bed and we're all under the covers, and you can see like, half my back without my shirt on and she looks back at him with the pillow and then at all of us again and goes, "You're all naked under there, aren't you?"
Junkie girl: I was supposed to be at work at 6:30 but I fell asleep on the train so since I'm late I said, "Fuck it, I'm gonna get some McDonalds."...It's because he was trying to fuck me while I slept last night...I didn't sleep for four nights and he's trying to fuck me while I'm sleeping...He should have been happy, I gave it to him twice last night...and once each to two of his friends...You know I'm a stripper and a model too.
Guy: What do you do to top double-teaming? Fuck a corpse?
Girl: So yeah, he would go over to her house and she'd be doing two guys at once.
Suit: Yeah, we'll fuck the fucker and we'll fuck him summarily.
Girl: Yeah, and one time he asked me if we could just fuck without kissing.
Guy on cell: You know, I think I'm man enough for three women.
Dude: I'd let him fuck my sister. He's a good guy.
Dude on cell: I wanna see you. I wanna feel you, too. I wanna feel you inside me. And suck on those titties, mmm.

Hobo: Well, mathematically speaking, I'm fucked.

Hobo: I don't steal. I don't snatch purses. I don't bother women. But don't get me wrong, I'm not a homosexual. But I do bathe. And I do sleep on the subway 'cause I am a bum.
Hobo: Anybody want to take the day off and cuddle with me? It's kosher!
Hobo: I'm just tryin' to get some pussy here and all y'all gotta come up in here and bother me. Damn.
Hobo: I've been shitting plastic lately.
Hobo: Please help me...Please help me...I need money to buy popcorn...Please help me...I need a hot meal...I need money to buy popcorn.
Hobo: Uh oh, uh oh! You make a big doo-doo! It's okay. I make big doo-doos too.
Hobo: Spare a little change, girls? That's all right, God bless
you...even the Chinese girl.
Hobo: The tax man has a licence to kill. No questions asked. More people should know that.
Hobo: If you see a suspicious black package on this train do not pick it up . If you see a large, black package on my seat after I leave, do worry. It is not a bomb . I've been riding this train for fifteen years. Leave it for the Coney island clean-up crew. They'll take care of it. It is not a weapon, it is not filled with hundred dollar bills, just don't it...Did you know that Union Square is a hundred years older than Times Square?
Hobo: Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the interruption. I am trying to raise one million dollars and 25 cents for wine research.
Hobo: All you people who just got on the train, everybody in this car already gave me $7. Everybody gave me $7 but you.
Girl: So I saw this homeless guy walking down the street with, like, all the bags and stuff, and he had something bewtween his !
Hobo: Hey man, help an ugly dude out, will ya?
Hobo: What's the holdup? Let's get this train moving! There's people gots to go to work, gots to go to school! There's pregnant people! Court musicians!
Hobo: Yeah, a couple of Jewish lawyers out to fuck the world...Shee-it.

Man: When I told her I worked for the State of New York she seemed to
lose interest.

Mom: I will never pay for the New York Times . You remember what they did? Printing our home address and pictures of Mommy and us half nude ? I will never pay for the New York Times . Remember how Mommy got letters from convicts? Because they're the only ones who have enough time to read the entire New York Times . Mommy will never give them a dime! They're lucky I didn't sue!
Girl: Not really, all they want to do is stay in my apartment and order delivery. They're from the suburbs and don't have delivery there.
Chick: I thought this was the ghetto, but I haven't seen, like, a single black person.
Mom: Honey, this train station is very crowded. That is why they call it Grand Central Station.
Tourist chick: Oh, so this is where it to be.
Chick: wow, the down escalator is so much easier than the up one.
Crazy guy: Shit, I like the Natural History Museum. But I'd like it better if there were whores all around it.
Girl: I couldn't ever take the train into work and have to deal with all the people. The trains are dirty, crowded, and takes a long time to get anywhere. That's the beauty of living in New York; you don't have to deal with those things.
Guy: So I was down on Canal, buying some of that perfume my wife likes for Valentine's. Some of that Chanel; usually it's $45 a bottle! But I talked this guy down to $25. I got it home, but before I give it to my wife, I spray a little on my hand--and it smells exactly like roach spray!
Cop on megaphone: Attention, Fordham preppies! Go back to the suburbs!

Little girl: Mommy, how old will I be when I have sex?

Girl: I tell every nigga I meet that I have four kids, and if they still want to holla, then that's more money for me.
Man on cell: ...So now she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father of the little bastard is...Just a second, more people are getting in...Ah, what the hell, maybe the father is on this elevator too.
Lady:...and I hate seeing the little children suffering. That's the other thing I hate about winter.
Man: I used to like it when I was a child, but then I was molested.
Professor lady: Well, did you all know that Osama bin Laden was one of about 50 children? That could actually explain some things about him, you know, not getting enough attention as a child. Maybe if he had been one of three instead, we wouldn't have so many problems, ha, ha, ha!...Please don't repeat this to anyone.
Dude: For real, dog, all I'm saying is that, she want to be with me, she gots to get rid of them kids. I ain't playing with no kids.
Mom: People steal children out of this place every single day of the year.
Hippie man: You ever notice how all the kids who walk to school smoke? They are all thin and smoking, and the lazy little brats who ride the bus are chubby with their legs all over each other.
Girl: You are lucky you are not a kid, I would beat your ass.
Guy on cell: Stop calling him a nino! He got hair on his balls!

Chick: Every time Todd talks to a girl he thinks he's on a date.

Woman: Make out with your boyfriend for me this weekend.
Teen boy: Oh, I just made up such a good joke. How do you know you're dating the dumbest bitch in the world? She points to the other side of the street and says, "Why are they whispering?". But they're not whispering, you just can't hear them 'cause they're far away. Dumb fuckin' bitch.
Chick on cell: Well, what do you want to do later?...Okay...Okay, how about we watch porn, have sex, and then go to the planetarium, in that order?
Guy: There are ! My ex-wife, I put the bitch through law school, and then she tells me--and I !--, "I don't need you anymore!" I found her at our safe deposit box, trying to empty everything and take it with her! There are no normal women in this city left to date. Sorry for my language.
Drunk girl: Let me put it this way: I didn't want to be hooking up with him I was hooking up with him. I started, and then I got stuck.
Black man: ...but I remember you. You spent the night at my house
and didn't have sex.
Girl: He was really hot, wasn't he? I got his number but I'm not going to call him for at least 3 days.
Girl on cell: It was an okay date, but we just talked about our cats, and I was like, " isn't sexy."
Lady on phone: Yes, I'm having dinner with him tonight...Really?...He didn't say anything about handcuffs.
Woman: Yeah, he cooked dinner for me. I thought, "Finally a good nice sensitive guy." Until this Lolita shows up in the living room. "Hey Dad, I'm here for the weekend. Who's this?"
Guy: I can either have a dog or a girlfriend. I can't afford both.

Queer: Hey, the red is looking really good on you. That's gonna be the next color of my living room walls, like God had a nosebleed!

Guy: Take a black man home, surprise your family.
Girl: Saturday was a day from Hell. I have no recollection of Saturday, because that was the day my dad said I had to choose...between a Cherokee and a Renegade. Now, the Cherokee was white, and the Renegade was green, and they had, like, completely different features. And finally, I chose the Cherokee, and for that I blame my mom, because I think she pressured me into taking a car I didn't really want, when what I wanted was the best features of both of them in one vehicle.
Woman: My favorite color is green...because, uh...it looks like trees.
Mom: Imagine if you were black. Wouldn't you feel invisible?
Suit: So, do we have to wear bright red underwear to his birthday party again this year?
Teen girl on cell: I didn't want to take the bus because it takes forever, but I also didn't see a train coming from the black hole...
Queer: She must have been white because if she was Puerto Rican, she would have slapped me!"
Mom: You already black; just go out at night.

Girl: I feel like if your vagina is wet enough, you won't get AIDS.

Man: Fucking shit doors. Fucking shit...Fuck these doors. This is a design. A design. A design. Cunts! Yup. Cunts designed this. Yup. Cunts and no one else.
Teen girl: You know I was thinking, if you ever wanted to like take some weed on vacation, you could just like make a fake tampon and...you know where I'm going with that one.
Suit on cell: I mean, what are we gonna give him, Vagisil?
Guy: Man, I think I've licked my last cunt.
Chick on cell: A vagina joke, eh? Let's see where you're going with this.
Man: Last night I had a dream I was eating my brother's pussy.
JAP: Do you believe she goes all the way to Queens to get her crotch waxed?
Latina: This guy eats me out so much he must think my name is Meatball.
Woman: I'm going to be the oldest person to ever have a sex change on 8th Avenue...by an unprofessional!
Woman: Ew, no way. If it ain't a brand name, I don't stick it in my cooter.
Teen girl: See, this is perfect for when it's cold out and this in here is for when you finger me.

Dude: Well, the other day she said, "I want you to fuck me in the park." So we went to the park, went behind some bushes where there was a clearing and bam, bam, bam. Then I came on her face.

Suit on cell: He ain't licking my forehead. He can lick your forehead all you want, not mine.
Girl: Oh my god, I recognized that huge forehead from a mile away!
Guy on cell: So I said to him, "Okay don't put it in my mouth, put it in my face."
Indian chick: Remember when I threw cum in Greg's face? He got so pissed!
Guy on cell: Hold on one second, I'm getting exfoliated.
Guy: Fine! How about I staple my balls to your forehead?
Chick on cell: I know. I really can't believe it. She has a face like pavement.
Hipster girl: I really want a blowjob. I mean nosejob! Nosejob! I don't know where that came from!

Little boy: What's the "n word," Dad?
Dad: I'm not gonna tell you.
Little boy: Why?
Mom: It's worse than all the other words because it makes specific people feel bad.
Dad: You don't need to know it. It's one of those things you'll learn when you get older. You'll learn a lot of bad things when you get older.
You'll learn all this and more, at 7PM on Wednesday night at the store above. Please come join us as we discuss and sign our new book .

Girl #2: Bowling is something that really isn't improved by doing it with someone else. I've bowling but I could go the rest of my life without doing it again. I mean, I know I'll have sex again, but I could give a rat's ass. Have you ever heard anyone say "I need to bowl real bad "?

Guy: So then why are guys from the Eastern Europe and black guys so good at basketball?
Dad: Natural selection.

island with England on it.

Tourist mom: Okay, thanks!

Hobo: Yo, can I get some money?
Guy: Sorry man, can't help you out.
Hobo: That's aight. Things are tough for everyone. Can you at least get me some water from your sink?
Guy: Uh, okay.
Hobo: Wait, let me find a bottle.
Guy: That's okay, I have a bottle I can give you.
He goes inside and comes back out with a bottle of water.
Hobo: Oh, thanks! Hey, wait. What, was this just sittin' around?
Guy: No, I just filled it up from my sink.

Black guy: Yeah, all the time.
White man: Are you related to him?
Black guy: Yeah, he's a distant cousin.
White man: Really? Wow! You must get this all the time.
Black guy: Yeah, even my girlfriend says it.
White man: Well, that must be the reason she dates you. She probably wouldn't date you if you weren't related to him.

Dude #1: I didn't brush my tongue this morning.
Dude #2: Yeah, I didn't have a cigarette.
Dude #1: No, I saw a sign that said, "Have you brushed your tongue today?"
Dude #3: No, you just have to go to the bathroom and throw up a little and then you'll be all set.

Bus driver: Back door's broken! Ha, ha, ha!
She hits the gas pedal.

Guy: Here's to 5 inches or less!
Girl: ...I really could take that the wrong way.
Guy: I'm talking about the storm!

Guy #1: You think anyone is gonna jump us?
Guy #2: Dude...we're in the middle of a fucking blizzard. Who is gonna jump us?
Guy #1: You never know, maybe one of those snow thugs.
Man: Aw geez, it's a winter freakin' wonderland!
Guy #1: Dude, they said on TV that it was gonna snow.
Guy #2: Nah, nan. It's not snow. It's frozen sunshine!
Girl #1: You know, I've never had sex in the snow.
Girl #2: Huh. Me neither.
Man: Yeah, that's how New Yorkers prepare for a blizzard...Order delivery!
Woman: Can I borrow your snow shovel? I need to clean my car.

He does. He is commando.

Chick: Do you know why I can't walk on this side of you on the sidewalk?
Guy: Why?
Chick: You're gonna laugh...
Guy: I'll laugh no matter what.
Chick: 'Cause this is not my side of the bed.
Guy: What?
Chick: If we were laying on my bed I wouldn't be on my side.
Guy: ? Yes you would. If we're laying on our backs this would be your side of the bed.
Chick: But I sleep on my stomach...
Guy: We're walking in the street, there is no bed!

Drunk girl #1: I met a guy last night!
Drunk girl #2: Oh yeah? Do tell.
Drunk girl #1: Well, um, it's not accurate to say that he had a Jay Leno caricature face.

Chick #1: I really think this is the way to go.
Chick #2: I told you, I'm not . They don't even know me. I don't want them to always think of me as "that lesbian girl." I said no.
Chick #1: I meant Eighth Avenue.

Hair lady: So how do you want it done?
Grandma: I want to have the same lining and density as that cute, little Chinese girl had.
Hair lady: It was a boy.

Guy #1: Nigga, where you goin'?
Guy #2: To the middle of the train. I wanna be in the middle.

Guy: Hey, is this the train that stops at that museum?
Girl: Which museum? The art museum?
Guy: No, the other one with all the bones and dead animals.
Girl: Ew. Why would you wanna go someplace like that?

Girl: Wait, what are you doing?
Guy: Huh? What do you think?
Girl: I mean, why are you putting your credit card into this box-thing?
Guy: To...um, get money?
Girl: Money? This machine gives you money if you have a card?
Guy: Um...this is, like, an ATM.

Teen girl #1: So I was like, "Ew dude, stop, you're too small. I don't even feel nuttin'!"
Teen girl #2: Yo, he gotta be at least 10 inches for me to even consider it.

Guy #1: Did you give anything to your boyfriend for Valentine's Day?

Guy: Yeah man, this girl was hot. It's not even questionable!
Crazy guy: Will anyone trade a quarter for fifty cents? Will anyone trade a quarter for fifty cents...You should be a model...I'm serious!
Woman: Oh my god, I what you've done with your face!
Old man: I tell you there is nothing quite so beautiful as seeing the human body used as an instrument.
Queer: Sweetie, you can't go selling yourself short and go saying that the other girls are better than you at auditions. If you want to go and say--I don't know---that they're prettier...Fine. I'd go with that.
Hobo: Hey, pretty lady...Congratulations! You're asshole of the year!

Teen girl: Now what she needs is a razor dildo.

Man: I'm gonna get a new dress for her from Goodwill.
Girl on cell: Listen to this: On Thanksgiving she gave us all copies of A Million Little Pieces . On Christmas we all got books about alcoholism.
Dude on cell: ...and he'll give her a hat, and it'll just be a big
diamond that sits on her head.
Woman: So I called to return the gnomes...You know, the ones we got for the wedding.
Girl on cell: It's like, I don't know what to buy, because it might be
for a guy or a girl. Like, I'm going to be the one that ends up with a
black double-ended dildo...No, they're gross and veiny and--Ugh, just no!
Queer: That motherfucker gave me walnuts! For Christmas! Motherfucking walnuts. At least give your secretary some lima beans or legumes, so I can throw some neck bones in 'em and make meal out of it. Fuckin' walnuts! I just sent an all-staff email to everyone and told them there were treats in the kitchen. Somebody ate 'em too.

Guy: It's good to like music. Wait, that came out really bad,

Guy on cell: Dude, the House of Pain is busy getting in a fight right now.
Irish guy: I broke my nose to this song.
Girl: I'm looking for something, um, lyrical.
Girl: You should have seen the other guy I almost hooked up instead
of the model...Total deranged farmer, looked just like Kid Rock!
Guy: I want to live with a group of singing nuns. They'll go about singing how I'm difficult but they love me anyway. And Mother Superior will have a great range and a vibrato like no other.
Professor guy: Willie Nelson smokes pot like a rastafarian, by the way.
Drunk guy: Sing us a song you're the rich motherfucker! Sing us a song tonight!

Hipster guy: Well, Hitler was right, there is a lot of parking in New York.

Tourist guy: Where are the trains?
Man on cell: Yeah, they're all listening to my conversation, this guy just helped me out, he told me where we are. This is awful, I shouldn't be talking on the bus...Because you don't. You don't talk on the phone on the bus.
Man on cell: No, we're probably going to go to the Rocket Feller Center.
Girl: Oh god, sorry. That wasn't a very New Yorkian thing to say, was it?
Woman: New Yorkers are so tall and robust because of all the roach parts they eat.
Hobo: Smile, New York. It won't mess up your hair.
Dad: Wow, this is just like Great Adventure. Where are all the rollercoasters?
Girl on cell: Yeah, no, I didn't get called back. I'm in Grand Central
right now, and there is this guy on the floor and he's totally bleeding all over the place. I gotta go. I want falafel and I'm broke as shit. I love you, Mom.
Chick on cell: So I'm on Canal Street right now. Yeah, I think that's near Chinatown.
B&T girl: They only gave the new trains to the 6 line because it doesn't go to Harlem. They aren't going to give people new trains.
Dad: I see it all the time. People are always falling over on the subways and buses and I just laugh and laugh.
Woman: Bagel fumes are a siren song if ever there was one.

Lady: I was fighting with this guy and his dog was in the room; that dog bit me.

British guy: She said I looked like Tony the Tiger! !
Old man: Lady, honestly I just don't give a shit about those fuckin' elephants. But that guy, he's about to bite into an elephant's cock!
Guy: Elephant picks up a lion and throws him. Lions ain't shit! Elephants! Dinosaurs!
Woman: No, well, she's half Maltese and half Labrador. I call her a matador...You know, to make fun of all those doodle breeds.
Girl on cell: Oh my gosh, I just saw a fight with the security guard and the guy with the big dog! You know what his dog looks like?...His dog looks like a camel. It just hangs...Yes, a camel.
Crazy guy: When they find me dead from diabetes, it'll be worth it 'cause I'll die happy! No, they won't find my body because my dog will eat me.
Little boy: Mom, I think bats eat rats.
Girl: Stop that, you sound like a goat!
Dog Show woman: Fifi didn't like ours, so we made them switch it! The second we walked in, she turned away, and I knew she wasn't having it! Isn't that right, darling?
Guy: That's not a dog, that's a pillow on wheels. Ha, ha, ha! Wait a minute. I mean that's a pillow on legs. Not wheels. Dogs don't have wheels.

Professor guy: I was going to give you all a quiz today. But then I realized that it was Valentine's Day. You're supposed to do something for the people you love on Valentine's Day. And of course, I love all of you very much. So...I decided to give you the quiz on pink paper instead!

Girl: Don't worry, it's cool to be smart these days. I'm not gonna like drag you down the stairs and beat you up.
Guy: My brother's pissed. He's in his second year of residency and he's already slept with all of the medical students.
Lady: I'll talk to you later...Yeah, I'm going home to smoke a J and
grade.
Suit: I am the best metaphor person ever. "It's like a this." "It's like a that." I'm so good at that stuff.
Old man: You ain't got no brain. What's the square root of 169 times 2? It's 13! You don't know 'cause you ain't got no brain!
Dude: Yeah, I really wanted to apply to study abroad in London, but my British accent !
Tween boy: Naw, man! I gotta go learn my education!

Dude on cell: I was up until 5AM having a really pointless discussion about apathy.

Businessman lady: I wish I could get paid to sit in a hole in the ground and smoke cigarettes.
Guy: Dude, all I want to do is play tennis and see my analyst.
Guy: Being on time is wack.
Guy: Things are different there. You don't really know exactly when you're going to graduate or anything. Like, you could show up for a final exam and the professor isn't there...And then, it could be six more months before you actually get your diploma. It's so totally laid-back there!
Woman: I don't want to go to work tomorrow. It's not that I don't like it, it's just too time-consuming.
Man: Hey, can I get this mail? And pay for my box? I drink a lot and today's my sober day; I want to get all my errands done.
JAP: Well, he was old. I don't think he was attractive, but I couldn't tell because I was tired.

 AM New York guy: Get your free newspaper! Why buy one when you are going to throw it away? The great thing about this is that it is free... Take one .
 AM New York guy: AM New York ! The free paper that covers New York like your security blanket!

Chick: So then this huge fat lady with really bad teeth said, "This is the most fabulous party I've ever been to," so I left.

Hobo: You are a princess. You are beautiful, woman. You are a beautiful princess. I always tell you that, don't I? I always tell you that. You will always be a princess. You will always be beautiful. Unless you get fat, then you won't be.
Chick on cell: Great, now I'm the fat sister!
Guy: You are so fat...Can I, like, ride your fat rolls?
Guy: I can't be a part of a couple that weighs over 300 pounds.

Teen girl: I asked George what his cousin looked like. He said, "He looks like me but with hazel eyes." How the hell am I supposed to know what he looks like? I don't know no one with hazel eyes.

Man: I know I seen you before. Listen to me, I know I have. I recognize you somehow. I know what it is: it's your fuckin' eyes!
Woman: I can't date him because he has that red thing in his eye.
Guy on cell: So he was buying fish? You gave him the evil eye?
Vendor guy: Here, take one. Just give it a listen. Listening's the new reading...You don't even have to use your eyes!
Professor guy: And this is a cross section of the human eye. If you don't like that, we can have the Star of David section of the human eye.

Girl: I think my mom's a virgin.

Girl on cell: We'll have sex the 78th Tuesday after Tuesday. Mark your calendar.
Girl: You're the sluttiest virgin I know.
Woman: ...So he took her virginity. Behind the, you know, the cannoli counter. She was sixteen.
Guy: He fucked 3 virgins in one day...True story.
Woman: Do not name that child Lester if you ever want him to lose his virginity!

Guy #1: I wake up at a quarter to 5 every day.
Guy #2: Why?
Guy #1: I get up to pee.
Guy #2: Every day?
Guy #1: It's that, or I go in bed.

Woman: I'll give you one up the butt if you let me be a stay at home mom.
Man: Once for every year you stay home.
Woman: Once per child.
Man: Once for every two years, or I'll be the stay at home.
Woman: Fine.

Girl #1: Is that a real fur coat?
Girl #2: Yes, oh my god and this woman started yelling at me this morning. I was like, "Please don't throw blood on me or something. I don't hate animals; I have a dog!"
Man: Not around your neck.

Chick #1: Do you have a book called White Supremacy by Fredrickson?
Store guy: No.
Chick #1: Can you see if any other Barnes & Noble has it?
Store guy: No, none in Manhattan. I take it it's for a class or something?
Chick #1: No, it's for my own, uh, personal knowledge. Thanks anyway.
Store guy: Sure.
Chick #2: I need a book of art or photographs by crazy people.
Next Wednesday, 2/22, the Overheard staff--both of us--will be reading and signing the new Overheard in New York book at the above location. It starts at 7.

Guy: Uh...poppy seeds.

Man: Miss! You are so beautiful! Your eyes! Your hair! Are you interested in modeling?
Chick: Uh--
Man: I love the way you walk. Imagine! Down a runway!
Chick: It's because my heel is broken, you fuckhead.

Guy #1: I can't believe I kissed both of them.
Guy #2: I kissed both of them too.
Guy #1: ...That means I, like, kissed you...
Guy #2: ...I don't even want to talk about this.

Girl #1: So then he kissed me, and it was really awkward, because I don't want to get involved with that train wreck.
Girl #2: So what did you do?
Girl #1: Told him that I really liked him, but I was seeing someone else exclusively.
Girl #2: You are? And you do ?
Girl #1: No, but being in awkward social situations makes me a compulsive liar.
Girl #2: Isn't that also your excuse for drinking too much?
Girl #1: That's really not fair to say.
Girl #2: So what did you do after that?
Girl #1: We did some vodka shots, and then I passed out on the subway and ended up in Brooklyn.
Girl #2: Good job.

Old woman: You still don't have any Halloween candy, huh?
Old man: Valentine's Day. It's Valentine's Day candy! Why do you keep calling it Halloween ?

Chick: You have no idea how much less anxiety I have now that I know I don't have to worry about leaving the country...not that they are kicking me out, but you know that I can leave and come back and it's not an issue...This just makes me so excited! When I get excited I start to twitch, I apologize, but it's a good thing! You get me excited! Not in that way, I mean, you're my professor, and female, but not to say you aren't good looking...
Professor: Um, okay, so let's pretend I was deaf for that last 30 seconds and I'll see you on Friday.
Girl: I guess I'll be taking my vibrator out for Valentine's.

Woman: Last month I thought I was in love with you. Now I realize I'm stupid.
Man: Stupid in love?
Woman: No. Just stupid.

Drunk girl #1: Oh god! You were flirting with him.
Drunk girl #2: No! I was kicking his ass.
Woman: Excuse me!
Guy: Jesus Christ...
Woman: I said, "Excuse me"! I said, "Excuse me"! You could have tried to move! I didn't try to step on you! I said, "Excuse me"! Don't you think that when someone says "excuse me" that might have a disability? I said, "Excuse me"! I said, "Excuse me"! Just because I bumped into you doesn't mean I want to have intercourse with you! You're going to try and have intervourse with me, I'm going to tell the police!
Guy: Hey wait, let me get your number, so we can have intercourse.
Girl #1: You just get crushes on everybody, don't you?
Girl #2: Not really, just on hot people.
Guy: What did he say after you told him we hooked up last night?
Girl: I said I was still in love with you and broke up with him before he could say anything. Did you tell your girlfriend yet?
Guy: Ha, ha! What do you think, I'm nuts?
Guy: Yo...if I had to choose between VD and a girlfriend...I'd choose VD.
Guy #1: Valentine's Day is so stupid. I'm going to boycott it, 'cause it's so commercialized.
Guy #2: Yeah...and also you don't have any girlfriends.
Hobo: Hey you! Do I know you? No...you look like a scarecrow standing there! Yeah, it's your smile, it reminded me. But I've gotta find me a real man. Gotta find him before Valentine's Day.
Teen girl on cell: So I totally did it and it didn't taste bad until
the end...Yes he did, but next time I won't let him...It sucks, 'cause I spit it all over my shirt...Ha, ha. Yes, well, he better call me back. Yeah, it's my stop. Okay, talk to you later.
Guy: ...So, can I get your number?
Girl #1: I hate Valentine's Day. It's so stupid.
Girl #2: I'll buy you flowers.
Girl #1: I just wanna have sex.
Girl #2: That's what I meant, I'll go down on you.
Chick #1: So anyway, Happy Valentine's Day!
Chick #2: Yay, right, I know.
Chick #1: Well eat a lot of pussy for me!

Guy: Dad, you had to see this broad; she must have been 200 to 250.
Dad: Like you're some prize. You are 40, divorced, have 3 kids and live at home with your parents.

Yuppie chick #1: Sarah D. Roosevelt Park! Remember when we bought crack there?
Yuppie chick #2: We didn't even buy crack. We just smoked it.

Hobo: Can you help me get something to eat?
Guy: Yeah, I got a slingshot in my bag. You prefer pigeon, rat, or squirrel?

Girl: Excuse me, which of these trains goes to Manhattan?
Suit: Shut up.
Southern woman: Oh! Are you a performer?
Chick: Yes, I'm studying acting and musical theater.
Southern woman: Wow! That's so amazing! Maybe we'll see you on Broadway one of these days! Good luck!
Chick: Thanks!
She leaves the train.
Southern woman: Yeah, right. Ha, ha, ha!
Old man: Is that a theater?
Old woman: No, it's a McDonalds.

Hobo: Hey, man. I got your back.
Guy: Got my back on what?
Hobo: I saw you park your car.
Guy: What are you, a fucking valet?
Hobo: Listen, man. You got some change? I just wanna buy me a beer. I ain't gonna lie to you...Today's my birfday!

Dude: Does that come with a meal?
Pasta guy: It is a meal.

Old man: You think Hillary Clinton could be president? You're out
of your mind. Hillary Clinton couldn't get arrested in a whorehouse with a fist full of fifties. She's ugly, she's stupid and she has a big fat ass. She's like a Hitler in female. All right, I'll stop now and be a gentleman.
Guy: Okay.
Old man: Any Democrat on this train who thinks Hillary Clinton could be president is masturbating in their mind. All one hundred of them.

Guy #1: Dumbass, Jesus's mom didn't fuck anyone. She was a fuckin' virgin. How do I know this and you don't? You're the Christian.
Guy #2: What are you talkin' 'bout? How could Jesus have been born if his mom hadn't screwed his dad? Wait, who was Jesus's dad again?
Guy #1: Dude, are you serious?

closing door. She turned her head like The Exorcist and just looked at me for a second and then starting screaming. And then other people started screaming while I tried to open the doors again. The conductor finally opened up the doors and she stepped in...and stood right next to me...and stared at me until Roosevelt Island. I just got out there and waited for the next train.

Drunk guy: You're not the boss of me...Bruce Springsteen is the boss of me.

Guy: Seriously. Puff's attorney called me the other day to say Puff wants me to sign a confidentiality agreement. Puff doesn't want me to disclose that he is the seller. I said to tell Puff that he's the one who has to sign a confidentiality agreement. If the boys at Goldman find out who I am buying from, my credibility is going to be shot forever.

Tutor guy: This one is singing..."Op-eh-ra." And this one is the name of a very famous woman.
Girl: What's po-ly-sex-u-al?
Suit on cell: Saying "fuck you" to someone in New York is completely acceptable.
Guy on cell: Hey bitch, which part of "dumplings and a movie" was unclear to you?

it's resolate.

Man: That fucking bitch brought up the time in '94 when I strangled her until she went unconscious. She said here that because of that I'm a danger to my kid in '06. Tell me what something in 1994 has to do with 2006?
Woman: Stop hitting her with that hard toy! Hit her with your fist instead.
Guy on cell: I mean...I wasn't about to beat a bitch, but...
Cashier guy: A girl said something a little disrespectful to me the other day, so I smacked her father.
Guy: Anyway, so I hit her in the face and was like, "When's the last time you got like this?" And she was like, "I don't remember!"

Hobo: Can anyone spare some change? In order to get a job, you need an ID and an address. I have neither. I would really like both. Can you help me out with some change or some food you're not going to eat? Perhaps a matzoh ball. Matzoh, matzoh ball. Man, I'd give anything for a matzoh ball.

Woman on cell: Why do you have to tease me by pooping at house?
Teen girl: Oh my god, I just peed on myself!
Dude: Talking to you is like taking a shit.

Drunk girl: What kind of guys do you like?...What kind of guys do you like? I like guys with big tits.

Chick: If I let you touch my boob, will you stay longer?
Girl on cell: ...Yeah, I know...Mom, I ...Mom, I gotta go, I don't have time to talk about your nipples right now.
Guy: She got the ill mole on her face; her cheek look like a titty.
Chick on cell: Yeah, don't you hate it when you're not wearing a bra and like one nipple gets hard and the one doesn't?
Girl: Yo Stacey, you want some breast milk?
Chick: Well I understand that, but that's no reason to set your nipples on fire.
Mail guy: Man, I got my fried chicken at Popeye's; their breasts are mad big. They like double Ds.
Chick: I think I'm going to be a lactation consultant.
Woman: I'm sure there are people in this world who have a fetish for big boobs and juice boxes.

Suit: My dick was totally in one hand pissing while I was talking to the client.

Dude: No for real, all you need to do is give a girl a nice stiff cock and she'll let you do whatever you want.
Girl: So we're goin' at it and he starts screaming and runs out of the bedroom, and I like follow him and he's standing there in the kitchen with his dick in a glass of milk.
Man: I keep tasting weiner.
Guy: And I said, "Man, do you really want to get on your ?"
Girl: It's like, "Well, it's the end of the night, I guess I'll put this in my mouth instead of a penis."
Guy: Excuse me! He has a mole on his dick! He has a mole on his dick!
Woman on cell: Nigga, I thought you always had your dick washed by 7!

Chick on cell: I need you to give me a ride home when I get off the bus. My grandma has been standing in front of my house for over one hour...I bet you anything she needs money again.

Guy: Wait, they're actually a dime a dozen?
Chick on cell: I don't want an intern making my fuckin' coffee, much less produce my fuckin' show.
Dude: That's not true; someone once charged me seven dollars and fifty-three cents for a smile.
Woman: Damn, girl, you workin' hard. What type of reward you gettin'? Monetary or bootitary?
Girl: I made a New Year's resolution to be less responsible, but it just didn't work.
Woman: I am just kicking myself for spending all that money on that stupid funeral!
Girl: I'm going to get in to work early tomorrow so I can quit.
Little boy on cell: ...You're not listening to me! It's not about the snack, it's about the fact that I've had a really hard day and I want to unwind a little.
Hobo: I would like to inform you of something you already know. You are all very cheap.
Guy: I have to cash this check; I just got out of jail and I need the money!
Girl: We're being listed through Mr. Vampire-man.
Old man: When I see that tenants have their windows open, I shut down the boilers. If there's a cold snap after that and they complain that there's no heat, I say, "Too bad. You had your windows open for a week!"
Girl: He only put two thousand dollars in my account, so we can't go too crazy.
Counter guy: Lady, would I be selling it if it weren't any good?
Lady: When she traded her kid for the house, I lost all respect for her.

Hipster guy: Dude, he always blames it on the train dispatcher. He needs to own his problems, you know?

Loudspeaker: Move to the front of the train. There's more room at the front...Well, you missed it. And that was the last one. We'll set up cots on the platform so you can spend the night.
Latina: I couldn't fit on that train. I want my money back.
Old lady: Gentrification? What they need to do is gentrify the subways!
Guy on cell: I'll be there shortly...I'm stuck on the train on the bridge.
Woman: Is 14th Street the next stop?
Teen boy: You know how we be hopping turnstiles all the time? I get so used to it, I hopped the turnstile on the way out the station. Cop saw me and grabbed me! Cop was all, "Date of birth?" and shit. I'm like, "I was going out!" and he's all, "Still looks like a hop to me."
Hobo: Ever notice how ugly New Yorkers are?...Don't take my word for it; just look at the person sitting next to you!
Woman: Where the hell is the uptown 6 train? This is crazy! Where the hell is the uptown 6 ?
Bus driver: This is the shuttle bus for the number 2 train. Don't expect to get where you are going in an hour. It's gonna take two. If you don't like it, call a car service, or get a ride with a friend, or stay home.

Construction guy: Well, she didn't sound Chinese over the phone.

Woman: did the real sex live up to the phone sex?
Guy on cell: She had yo brother when she was nine? Ew, yo momma a freak...Am I on speaker phone?
Woman: Mom is always listening in on the other line when I talk to dad. The other night he said, "You're such a nice person", and I said I must have got that from him and we heard a click.
Girl: No guy would spend that much time texting you if he wasn't serious.
Guy on cell: Man, that's the worst, when you're jerking off and a friend calls. Like you really want to jerk off, but you really want to talk to your friend too.

Guy: Did you see that woman? She looked at us like she'd never seen a black man before.

Girl: I just said the n-word in front of a "n"!
Guy: Yo, the Africans: they black. The Asians: they black. There gonna be too many of us!
Black man on cell: They are some racist fuckers in there. They wouldn't help me because they are so racist. And you know what, that racist motherfucker was a bin Laden bitch too!
God Squad guy: I get the best reaction from the blacks. The black people are more spiritual. They got one up on us. But it's not us and them. We're all one person. You're just a different shade of white, and I'm a different shade of black.
Drunk guy: There's fuckin' cops everywhere. The worst ones are black. No wonder everyone hates 'em.
Black chick: Four generations out of slavery, and now I command a robot army.

Guy on cell: I can feel the juice runnin' down my leg. It's leaking !
Fashionista: If I'd just taken a shower everything would have been all right.
Suit: You gotta come early, like 5 o'clock, when they're still clean. You don't need another dick already in 'em.
Girl on cell: That's not cleansing. Not eating anything ever is not a way of cleansing your body.
Guy: The next time you complain that I don't take the trash out, I'm going to remind you that it was not me who put beef blood in our bed.
Tourist woman: The sight and smell of it was so disgusting! I was
like, "Is this porn?"
Lady: Dammit, how many times have I told you? Don't lick the bird shit!

Guy: Dude, I think I just farted on a model.

Conductor: Ladies and gentlemen, this Q train is currently making local stops due to the 12 cups of snow outside.

Dude: No way, fuck , wind!
Girl: Sometimes you can't see love, but you can feel it. It's like the wind.
Asian girl: Whoa! It's raining ice!
Girl: They look slutty. Slutty people don't get cold.
Hobo: This weather crazy. Father Nature caught Mother Nature cheatin' on him, got mad, and dropped some damn snow on us!
Girl: ...I mean, who doesn't like being warm? It's not like they call it "Global Sweltering"! So who cares?
Conductor: Again, the delay is due to the 12 cups of snow outside.

Girl on cell: Oh my god, I'm shopping with my mom, and she's shopping for !

Lady cop: Usually my bedroom is off-limits but I let my son go read in there the other night and I walk in and he's going though my drawers and he found my dildo ...And he knew what it was, too!
Guy: Dude, if they ever ask you for a massage, don't get one. They strap this weird dildo thing on their hands and then rub it all over your face. Then it makes this chuga chuga chuga sound. It's ridiculous.
Girl: No, I've upgraded. This one's named Excalibur. It's a Rabbit.
Guy: Man. Stimulated by a 50 cent banana.
Girl: I don't know, all I remember is that when I woke up in the morning there was a cucumber with your menstrual blood on it.

Guy: Have you ever been on the East Side on St. Paddy's day? I was there last year, and there were guys--grown men--wearing business suits and everything, just pissing in the middle of the street. It was magical.
Hobo: God bless the Irish! And God bless John Gotti too!
Robin Williams: If you're wearing a green hat like that I get to bitch-slap you.

Girl #2: That's almost rape! Sweetie, he's probably some sick pedophile.

Woman: Aw! Where's my bagel? They forgot to put in my bagel!...Don't worry I'm not crazy. I'm just talking to myself, that's all.

Dude: So I was looking in the freezer, right? And I pulled out this chicken that expired in 2004. The date on it was like, April 2004. But that's the thing about fresh chicken that you get wrapped up at the store. There's no frozen date, you know?

Doorman guy: Do you think I'm stupid because I work here? I know a lot of big words.
Elle Ron Hubtard: I don't want to put words in your mouth or anything, but...
Man: You know how when you're appointed, you feel let down because something that you expected to happen, didn't happen; like, it didn't happen as appointed? That must be the original meaning of disappointed, how it was used in the past. Like "ruthless". You never hear anyone today talk about having ruth, but in the past they must have used it like that.
Teen girl: Wait, what's the intifada? Wait, do any of you speak Spanish?
Dude on cell: See, we were what you call the goats...You ever heard that expression?

Little girl: He says you can buy him for free and you only have to touch him on the neck and tickle him a little.
Girl on phone: Whatever, she could totally do it with one hand. There were two girls in my school with only one hand.
Guy: I have a sphincter in my finger.
Girl: I'm not saying touching a motherfucker's foot ain't intimate, but...

Mother: Hmm...remind me to make a stop at The Home Depot on the way home. Your father said he needed a stripper to remove some paint.

Girl: I want to be poor so I can take a job as a dominatrix!
Man on cell: Don't you have any hookers with ?
Chick: You know, I was once offered millions of dollars to be a stripper.
Girl: I better be a stripper if I'm going to walk 16 blocks!
Store guy: See, my father and my uncle were pimps. And my grandfather and his father before him were assistant pimps.
Hag: Totally. I mean, did you see the balls on that stripper? They

Catholic girl: It's my mom's fault really; she smoked a lot of weed when she was pregnant with me.
Lady: ...and as it turns out, the demon got her pregnant.
Teen girl: I don't wanna be pregnant though and go through all that. I just wanna one, ya know?

Girl: If anybody is gonna bring back the cape it will probably be a
lesbian.

Woman: What? I'm supposed to watch a lesbian show just because I am one? I don't watch any black shows either.
Black chick: If I sit down and you can see my ass it ain't cool...Unless you a lesbian or something.

Hobo: Nice thighs -- have another doughnut.

Woman #1: And so I told him, 'I love New York, and I'm not coming back to Portland. When you get home, pack up our stuff and come out to New York.'
Woman #2: Wow. You better marry that boy.
Woman #1: Well, he's already married.
Woman #2: Oh...
Woman #1: It's okay, I'm in no hurry.

Old lady #1: So I think maybe that's the problem with New Yorkers.
Old lady #2: No decaf?
Old lady #1: Yep, no decaf. That's the problem.

Waiter: Every time I see you, you look younger.
Older man: Oh?
Waiter: Younger, fresher, more rejuvenated...
Older man: I'll remember you in my will.

Girl #1: You mean, your parents never kept you in a cage as a child?
Girl #2: Uh... no.

Teen boy #1: No, the gold one is called 'CD3' or something. The little one is, like, 'R4M23.'
Teen boy #2: I think the gold robot was named 'R3DM24.' It was the small one that was 'C-something.'
Teen boy #3: No, man, the gold guy was 'C3DDO,' and the little silver one was 'RH52' or some shit.
Frustrated 30-something lady behind them: The gold one is 'C3PO' and the smaller one is 'R2-D2'!
Teen boy #2: Oh, thanks -- you can tell we're not Trekkies.

Health services assistant: Can I help you?
20-something male: Yeah, okay. See, so I woke up in a hospital this morning, and I have no idea how I got there, and I can't find my Columbia ID card and so I can't get back in the dorm.
Health services assistant: Um...
20-something male: My wallet had everything left in it except my ID card. I asked all over the hospital and no one knows where my ID card is. I asked everywhere.
Health services manager: Which hospital? St. Vincent's?
20-something male: Yeah, St. Vincent's.
Health services manager: Do you know who brought you there?
20-something male: No, I have no idea how I got there.
Health services manager: Um... So how can I help you?
20-something male: How can I find my ID card?
Health services manager: Maybe check with the Lost and Found at the hospital, or go to ID services and see if someone turned it in.
20-something male: Okay. Thanks. Bye.

Sorority girl #1 texting on cell: I hate how words can sometimes spell other words.
Sorority girl #2: Yeah, I know.

Chick #1: So, I overheard that weird girl in my anthropology class talking about how she bought a glass dildo the other day.
Chick #2: A glass one? I didn't even know they made glass ones.
Chick #1: Yeah, I don't know. But imagine if it cracked -- how much that would hurt.
Chick #2: Did you ask her about it?
Chick #1: Fuck no. I figured I'd just Google it later.

High school girl #1: My family is full of sluts. My sister just had a baby, my cousin just had a baby, my other sister just had a baby...
High school girl #2: So your mom's a slut, also?
High school girl #1: Naw, my mom ain't a slut.

Extremely obese Tourette's woman: Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuckin' fuck!
Little girl: Why is that lady shouting?
Mother: She's probably upset about something.
Little girl: Maybe she ran out of pineapple and forgot to get more at the store. Or maybe her undershirt itches. Or maybe her gerbil is sick.

Female student: I have a question -- what is the plural for 'clitoris'?
Professor: That is a question.

Meathead #1: Yo, you drinking tonight?
Meathead #2: It's Tuesday... Of course I'm drinking tonight.

Barnard girl #1: Wait, so he broke up with you? What a jerk!
Barnard girl #2: I know, but whatever -- it's his loss.
Barnard girl #1: But did he even tell you why? What a piece of shit.
Barnard girl #2: Well, no. But I think it had something to do with me not liking guys or the fact that I slept with his sister, but he didn't tell why, exactly.
Barnard girl #1: Um, yeah, okay then.

Dad: How about Akeelah and the Bee
Teen daughter: Ehhh...

Teen daughter: Dad!

Kid #1: Yo, it would be awesome to go trick-or-treat here tonight.
Kid #2: Idiot, Jews have Halloween in April or something.

Guy #1: So what's the deal with that chick who was talking to you?
Guy #2: Well, I think she's absolutely atrocious. But yeah, I'd hit that.

Girl #1: Hey, so I went to that sushi place you told me to go to last night, and I got food poisoning!
Girl #2: Oh. Hey, you went there? How was it?
Girl #1: I got food poisoning.
Girl #2: Yeah, but how was it before the vomiting set in?

Teen girl #1: My teacher bought this awesome notebook for me.
Teen girl #2: Why?
Teen girl #1: 'Cause she likes me.
Teen girl #2: Is she gay?
Teen girl #1: No. She's Jewish.

Students: Monday.
Professor: Shit!

Employee #1 on phone: So, I'm at your apartment and I found your pipe, but I can't find your--
Employee #2: Dude, stop... You're on speakerphone!

Teen girl #1: Are you, like, anorexic now?
Teen girl #2: That is the nicest thing you ever said to me.

Blond: You need to go jump off this balcony right now.
Brunette: It's the first floor
Blond: Good, 'cause then you'll just break your leg. I love you, I don't want you to

Boyfriend: I'm sorry, I just can't be with you anymore. You're too clingy.
Girlfriend: I'm not clingy! I fucked, like, ten other guys!
Boyfriend: While we were dating?
Girlfriend: Whatever, it was because you're not that good in bed. Oh, yeah, I faked all my orgasms, by the way. And my boobs? --Aren't water balloons!
Boyfriend: Dude. First of all, we're on a motherfucking-packed subway. Second of all, being a crazy bitch isn't going to help your case.
Girlfriend starts crying hysterically: You can't break up with me! I you! I you! I love you
Stranger, to boyfriend: If you're thinking of killing yourself after this, I sell knives.

Man #1: How was your weekend?
Man #2: Shitty.
Man #1: Well... When did you first suspect your mother was gay?
Man #2: I don't wanna talk about it, okay?

30-year-old #1: So we went out on Thursday, and he didn't call me Friday or Saturday, which was good. Then he showed up at the party on Sunday and didn't talk to me for the first 35 minutes. Yesterday, he left me a message telling me how nice the party was, and I haven't called him back.
30-year-old #2: But you like him.
30-year-old #1: Yeah, I think it's going well.

Customer: Do you have pancetta?
Deli guy: We have white cetta and orange cetta.
Customer: Okay. Do you have prosciutto?

Hipster girl #1: I better watch out -- after the weight I lost, my mom is thinking I'm anorexic or something. I should start eating more.
Hipster girl #2: Yeah, or lay off the coke.
Hipster girl #1: Or that.

Little boy #1: Nudists are rich!
Little boy #2: Really? Why?
Little boy #1: They don't have to buy clothes!

Girl: [In the month of October] Why is there a leprechaun passed out on those steps?
Friend: Oh, wow. Is it April Fools' Day?

40-something preggers: So my mother insisted on coming into the room when I had my last pelvic exam.
Other patient: Seriously?
40-something preggers: What's worse is that she was standing near the doctor while he was doing the exam. She was watching.
Other patient: What? No way!
40-something preggers: Then she said to the doctor, 'Can I hold something for you?'

Hobo: Booga-wooga-wooga!

Trick-or-treating child: More! More! More!

Little boy in bathroom: Oooh... Dad, I love you.
Dad outside stall: I love you, too, buddy, but you don't have to tell me that when you are on the crapper.

Kindergarten girl #1: Wow! Look at all those big trophies!
Kindergarten girl #2: Those ain't trophies. There's dead people there. Yeah, you know -- you go to church, you pray, and they put the dead person in the box, and they put the box in there. Don't you go to church?

NYU girl #1: It's almost like... a pseudo-lesbian crush... I mean, I don't wanna touch her or anything.
NYU girl #2: Yeah, I don't wanna touch her, I just...
NYU girl #1: I just, like, want her to lay in my bed with me and tell stories.

Queer pointing at eccentric woman reading sides of soup cans with a spy glass: I want to be more like that.

In your face wine - rather obvious and simple (although some structure did begin to show through). ***
Some volatility, and all over the place on the nose and palate. It did come together more with time. ***
Gummy nose, merlot-style sweetness. Good wine, but not in a style I was expecting. ****
Hot on the palate, but good balance with some maturity. ***
This has a Rhonish air to it, feels quite young, but it is also a bit simple. ***

A big nose of public swimming pools - bizarre (some might say funky). *

Very vinous - Burgundy with bubbles, to some extent and so a bit much in some ways.  I suspect it needs time to mellow - it will be interesting to see how this develops (this bottle was disgorged only last year).   If all goes well ***(*)
All quite refined and delicate, appley pinot fruit, autolytic flavours. Another fairly recent disgorgement after 4 years in cellars (credit the producer for an excellent back label), it just seems a bit lacking in intensity despite the obvious quality. Perhaps this will develop but for now a good ***
Good fruit - nice acidity. Pretty intense although it seems quite evolved for a young wine - I fear it may go down the Ozzy route of rather early flabby kerosene flavours.  Top  **
Curiously Sauvignon-like - quite rich. Odd balance - people were saying this is a vineyard Huet took on and then abandoned. Good wine but it doesn't seem to have the class of their major wines. A low **(*)
Pretty nice.   Clean, rich, yet decently taught.  A credit to the appelation. Bare ***
A weak cork and a rather oxidised bottle - one sips for a while but then abandons it. I have had much better. Not Rated
Very light and delicate - decent but a bit attenuated. I have had better bottles.  ***
Dry, savoury, quite succulent. Pleasantly high-toned, nervy, and a bit awkward.  A wine with a sense of place and hence enjoyable. ***
Curiously quiet, but concentration and fruit quality are all there.  Maybe just in a dull phase - perhaps it would have shown better decanted and allowed a little air.  ***
Leafy, dry, decent balance. Good wine but I doubt it's going anywhere much.  Pleasant, and perhaps it would reward further attention.  **
Quite baked, decent concentration - slightly hot finish. I recall having had better from this producer.  **
Refined, smooth sweet (to a controlled extent) - very drinkable. Forward fruit but with the balance to hold it - the best of the New World reds, to my palate. Top ***
Huge monster - alcohol gets up my a nose and in my throat rather.   I find this a bit much. Returning to it later it seemed to have mellowed quite a bit  and to be a substantial wine in its way, although I find it hard to decide about it. Many will admire this, and I may too given time to consider it - I had it eight and a half years ago and was impressed.  I think I'll reserve judgement for now. Not Rated
A bit anonymous in some ways, but very nicely poised fairly concentrated dessert wine - from the South of France somewhere, I guess. I suspect this would repay more attention and on that basis ***
Beautifully refined.  Complex, elegant, long with the amazing precision so typical of the producer. Lovely.   ****
Eccentric - very rancio - complex and interesting - I need more time with this but for now  ***

Raspingly dry, mineral, appley, severe, touch of honey developing, long.  ***(*)
Very fresh, lifted, aromatic. Top *
Dry, clean, unassuming. Touch of spritz. *
Fruity, peachy. Dry again. More richness. Nice sense of place. I could even think of ***
Quite mouthfilling - dry, fruity. Nice.  **
Soft, cigar cassis fruit - sweet finish. Pleasant. Nice condition. ***
Soft blackcurrant fruit - with tannic background that starts to show in the midpalate. Odd balance. **
A bit stinky at first - resolves - tar roses but the common old Barolo oxidativeness.  Tarry - quite hard work. Actually probably good. Top ***
Rich again - gamy animal dry - could do with long decanting.  Bare ****

Charming tempranillo sweet strawberry nose. Good balance and elegant. A good ***
Modern stuff, rather lacking depth and complexity. **
At peak or just over. Rather like a decent Cotes-du-Rhone, with a rustic edge. ***
Pretty awful - very soft and commercial. Confected. *
A couple of wines from a big bash at an Edinburgh hotel.   It's a good idea once in a while to remember where the baseline is.
Clean, pretty dry, but low on real concentration. A respectable  No Stars
Clean again, clearly rather dilute, quite leafy and a touch of (not necessarily bad) green-ness. Again a respectable No Stars
Each done as a vertical - single blind
A slightly embarrassing start to the evening with people thinking this was vintage (1990 or 1996), possibly Krug, possibly Billecart. Lovely wine whatever. A touch of pink on the colour - a blush to cover our blushes. Elegant, good length and fine balanced acidity. A really good, cheap (under 15) fizz. ****
Mature with Grenache cherry showing through. Charming nose. Slightly simple on the palate. A good ***
Slightly flat liquorice nose. More depth than the 98. Closed up and allowing the alcohol to  show through, but I think this will come together well. ***(*)
A touch gummy and with a hint of leather. Drier than many. Robust. ****
Youthful (obviously the youngest wine of this flight). Powerful wine with lovely softy tannins at the end. **(**)
Past its peak, although still very drinkable. Fruit is starting to dry out and a touch of volatility is appearing. **
This vintage had a juiciness about the fruit that was lacking in the other wines, but was also maturing well - at an in-between phase I guess. ***
Corked. Not Rated
Green tannins, dry at the end, a long, soft, not that pleasant leathery length. ***
Vegetal blackcurrant. Soft and not together. **
Very young and closed. Minty. But does it have the structure? ***
A stinky nose to start with. Leather, and just beginning to dry out. ***
a touch vegetal, and some volatility. Just ***
a bit of blackcurrant, clean and nicely together. A top ***
Some thought this stunk rather. I thought it the finest wine of this flight. Lovely fragrant mature Shiraz nose. At peak. Good. ****
Toffeed, bit dry, volatile. No Stars
Cream crackers on the nose (no that's not rhyming slang). Vanilla. Simple. ***
Quite acidic, some fruit. A solid ***
Corked. Not Rated
Simple cherry fruit and acidity. Rustic at the end. ***

Very slight almost unnoticeable spritz, but otherwise mature and together and pleasant drinking. A top ***
Young and closed, but seemed a bit simple. **(*)

On the whole, well made stuff, but there does seem to be an odd dull metallic note to the wine. Otherwise there is soft, well-balanced fruit. **
A good, fruity, balanced drink. Pleasant food or quaffing wine.***
The usual Penfold's style - well made, and with a touch of volatility helping with the balance. ***

Dry, clean, nice piney (is that allowed?)  spicy perhaps is better. Reasonable complexity once it has warmed up above the icy temperature at which it was served. Decent length. Top **
Nice white-pepper spicyness - balanced and long - the extreme nature of the vintage less apparent than I feared.  **(*)
Honied - interesting green-tinged high-toned fruit.  Bone-dry and rather nice.  Time to drink though. Bare ***

Fresh, grassy, a bit vegetal.  Fruity and a touch sweet.  Top *
Drier, quite intense.  Hints at almonds and lime. **
Slightly corked. Not Rated
A touch reductive/sulphury.  Forward fruit - pleasantly dry.  Top **
Nice intensity. Aniseed. Fades a touch.   Good value. ***
A touch of ginger.  Rounded fruit like a top-class Macon.  Nice intensity and clean, pretty dry palate.  Very good.   ***(*)
Intense pure cassis, ripe with some quite dry succulent tannins.  Fairly sweet impression on the palate. **
Sickly toffee-fudge nose. Sweet fruit.  I don't like this. *
Sweet soft-drink fruit.  It expands a bit but I still find it too soft.  For somebody who likes the style: ***
Very sweet, some mushroomyness but so sickly - might almost be a desert wine.  I really don't want to drink this. I can't even bring myself to give it stars on an "if you like this sort of thing" basis. No Stars
Quite sweet - very soft fruit. Herby and lifted. Decent *
Still a bit soft for my palate - has Mt E always been this easy?  Certainly the best of the three. Bare ***
Almost Madeira-like.   It suffered a bit on serving - it was rather sedimenty. Pleasant but fading a bit. **
Almost dry - nice, but no better than  it should be given the reputation of the vintage.  ***

Very classic cedary, mature Claret nose.  Classic on the palate too, but there is an air of living dangerously, of corruption, and a general hint that the wine will crack up.  Really needs food now and probably should be drunk in the next year or two.  ***
Classic again on the nose, but a rather fresher, more stable palate with complex multi-faceted fruit.   Once open for an hour or so it becomes fragrant and high-toned.  Drinking well and no hurry to consume.  ****
This was one of three Chapel Down wines (and a few refreshing and pleasing bottled beers) supplied by the winery.
I don't get to try an awful lot of Bacchus nowadays, although way back I used to attend the English Wine Fair and try samples there. I can't say I miss it much. This wine is floral, grapefruity and with hints of sauvignon-like flavours. Strangely for a cleanly made 11% white wine, it isn't the sort of stuff you want to drink a whole bottle of - it's not unpleasant, just that the acidity and fruit somehow manage to dull the tastebuds. Hopefully the Champagne style Pinot that was also sent will be more interesting. *
Does wine travel well? This Champagne seems to have. Packing the car recently, I opened up one of the underfoot storage compartments to pack a bottle of fizz when I found - to my surprise - a bottle already in there. This, I worked out, had been in the car for the last couple of months (going everywhere the car went - a thousand miles or so - in the cold and in the warm). Unfortunately I didn't have another, untravelled bottle of this around for comparsion.
Lovely fizz, with good nutty steely age on the palate. Fine depth of flavour, although the palate does tire very slightly at the end. Really on very good form. ****

Good fruit and depth of colour. Very obvious new oak on the palate. Good drinkable modern wine. ***

Fragrant, dry palate, quite meaty and serious.  Time to drink I guess - it will never be soft and the fruit is fully mature.  Rather enjoyable. ***
I don't often drink village Chablis. This is a good example of what you get from a good one: all the stony minerality and dryness of a premier cru but just a bit less intense and refined.   Best with food. **
Seems a bit thin and mean straight from cellar, but when it warms up its fantastic: dry and succulent but with intense strawberry fruit and a bit of beetroot in the mouth.   Quite structured - it will probably improve a bit yet. Am I being overgenerous with ***(*)
Quite tight and lean,   I wondered a bit whether it wasn't a little thin when judged by the highest standards, but while not an absolute star, more and more emerged with some breathing.   Very well-defined hazelnut fruit and taut acidity.  Excellent wine with no sign of the problems that plague some wines in this vintage.  Top ***
Lovely bright, crisp red fruits.  Excellent concentration and balance, great fruit but bone dry.  Just a lovely village wine, I thought at first - but after some time to breath it seemed to have complexity and interest beyond that.  Top ***
Top, top quality. Creamy fruit,  lean, complex and mineral - with only a slightly reduced intensity and length reflecting the modest vintage. ****
Very good village wine - good fruit and the fine acidity of the vintage. Delicious. A good ***
Quite rich, forward, exotic fruit.   Drinking nicely.  This bottle had been forgotten in a freezer overnight, and then thawed - didn't seem to have done much damage, and as my host remarked it's an easy way of opening the bottle. **
Pure, quite mineral,  the fact that this is a "no new oak" wine very pleasingly evident.  Quite a lot of richness to the fruit too, specially once it had been open for half an hour.   Could probably do with a couple of years and might age well for longer.   Nice wine.  Bare ***

Understated, quite complex, but a little flat and dominated by a caramel/toffee overlay that I'm not keen on.   Being a Tempier fan I was expecting a lot from this, but on this showing I'm not wildly keen. **
Dull, very deep-coloured and tending to oxidation.  Nothing like a couple of other halves of this from the same lot which were lovely.  An early case of "poxy white Burgundy" or just a dodgy cork? Not Rated
Attractive and drinkable, but lacking the mineral complexity of the Launois NV drunk recently. ***
Pleasant mature rieslong - needing drinking fairly soon. Bare ***
Writing up my notes from visiting D-J in Rully persuaded me to open this, brought back from their cellars.
Bright, attractive and authentic, but lacking any special buzz.  I wrote that on initially drinking a glass or two: returning the following night this has opened out and is showing lovely minerality.   Scrapes ***(*)

From a magnum (well it was New Year's Eve). I think I've had this bottle for five plus years. Lovely stuff - beautifully balanced. Could still have used a few more years. A very easy ****

Deep colour, very yeasty nose and honied appley fruit with bags of mushrooms. Evolved. Quite bold and rich.  Long and delicious, provided you like the meaty, not so elegant, Bollinger style - it's not everyones glass of bubbles.  Top ****
Quite elegant but rich (some botrytis perhaps).  Very fine.  ***(*)
Mineral, nice fruit, dry and taught.  Starting to drink nicely.  Bare ****
Deep colour, rather lovely, gentle, long, mellow, nutty and delightful.  Some say a little lacking poise or complexity but I quite like it.   ***
Pure, quite light and aetherial (the vineyard perhaps).  Nice length and texture. Pleasingly little oak. Still improving but may be won't merit another star.  Pretty good.  ***
Dusty, quite large but dry. Tending towards baked (typical of the vintage) - a little chunky. Still pretty good. Quite a Clarety style of Burgundy. Bare ***(*)
Closed at first, but opens out - lovely pure raspberry fruit. High-toned. Very long. Needs a few more years to peak.  ****(*)
Dry, nice, savoury,  but time to drink.  Top ***
Colour tending to brown.  Quite animal,  rich and decadent - fades a bit in the glass and rapidly becomes cloying. **
Amazing dense young colour. Floral, mineral, tobacco. Iodine finish.  Very fine indeed.  *****
Mineral nose, rich cherry fruit hot iron finish.  Fantastic interest - packed with ripe tannins. Great balance - but lots of potential. Top ****(*)
Very easy, silky, forward. Touch of class.  I would like to try this from a stronger vintage and with a bit of age. ***
Apricot fruit, creamy texture and flavour. No great complexity (typical  of Eiswein).  Lovely acidity. Bare ****
As it opens up, rather fine - raspberry fruit, touch of chocolate, a bit spirity towards the end.  Moderate weight now. Top ****
Very fresh, lots of fizz. Touch of yeast, etc - a touch shorter and less weighty than the Bolly.  In spectacularly good condition and with fine, precise bready flavours. Lovely Top ****

From a half. Its usual reliable self - fine bubbles and good medium-weight balance. ***
From a half. Simple and charming. I love claret like this, especially when the purpose of the evening is purely social rather than wine related. This is at peak and a pleasure to drink. ***
OK stuff with decent fruit. A touch coarse. **
Beautiful. Especially after a bottle of indifferent Prosecco drunk with candied(?) hibiscus flowers in the glass. The Lynch-Bages is elegant, and suggests an inner depth that is not at present fully forthcoming. Hints of peach kernel and tempered steel. ****
Poor alongside the Lynch-Bages. Too soft and undemanding. ***
This needs a bit more time. Good structure and supple tannins - medium length. A good ***

Brought round by a friend for a Sunday lunch. A slight whiff of the farmyard when first opened, but this cleared to reveal a light-to-medium weight claret with classic cigar box. ***

Rich vanilla fruit, excellent concentration.  Not the last word in elegance and the mousse is a bit coarse - but overall a splendid wine.  At least a good ***(*)
Fruitcakey Claret, quite big and robust - seems a little woody at first but returning a day later it's clean, nicely-toned mature wine.   Chunky and in the final analysis not that complex, but good. ***

Vanillan, lovely mousse,  very elegant.  Understated class. ****
Rich, good riesling character, quite a lot of residual sugar.  Good in its way. ***
Lovely fresh fruit.  Complex, delicate nose. Falls off a bit in the mouth.   Opens out with some air and holds up well on returning after the other wines.  This is one of their lesser wines - it's a credit to the property. ***
Rich, lively, smoky, very nice. Less fine than the Cubillo but richer.  (From a half.) ***
Inky, tannic, plummy, a bit baked. Lovely secondary characters merging.  ***(**)
Suaver, rounder, suggestive of Pomerol.  Pure and a touch  higher-toned than the Barton.  Not ready but a bit shorter-term too. Top ***(*)
Terribly refined, mature Claret. Great breed and balance.  I sometimes find Pichon just a little too suave and lacking edge for my tastes, but this is a super wine. ****
Nice old nose. A touch of tea - good but doesn't develop on the palate. Creamy vanilla.  Just a bit rubbery but that becomes less noticeable as it opens in the glass. ***
Gamy,mineral yet edgy and unbalanced.  Interesting yet also slightly flawed. Possibly a dodgy bottle.  Top  ***
Rich, limey fruit.  Young-seeming. Apple finish. Excellent - marred ever so slightly by a raw woody background.  Top ***
A touch pruney and hard - opens up a bit but remains  a bit unsatifyingly remote.   I would expect more.   ***
Fresh, fragrant raspberry nose. Fine, elegany, light palate. Joyfully lovely. *****

Elegant as always, silky-testured drinking wine.  but I don't feel this has the power for long-term evolution that (say) the 1990 has.  Drinking nicely now. Top ***
Drinking (from a half) really beautifully now.  A delight. ****
I recall being a bit disappointed last time I drank one of these magnums.   This one however is delightful, mature, berryish St Emilion.   Breed and balance to the fore.  Very good drinking. Top ***

Initially modern, rich, almost flashy.  Later, gamy.  Not sure what to make of this - it's not like the Vallana wines of old but it is quite substantial. Top  **
Pure, luscious. Not really a keeper on this showing.   Top ***
Funky, showing age, substantial but odd. ***
Nicely integrated, a touch sweet and easy perhaps but high quality. Top ***

Fragrant nose with a tar underlay.  High-toned, pure yet quite gutsy tannins too.  Persistent on the finish with chocolatey notes.  It's pretty tightly wound still and a bit enigmatic.  My guess is a bare ***(*)

Clean, dry, attractive. Very drinkable. **

Very pure, high-toned yet silky fruit.  Somewhat in the Burgundian style but with roses, tar and chocolate and noticable but ripe Nebbiolo tannins.   On the other hand it has that floral scentedness of proper old-fashioned Bordeaux.  Doubtless worth keeping a few years but it is so well-made it is a pleasure to drink now. Top ***

Perhaps starting to tire a bit nice fruit, quite dry-seeming now with a bit of Pfalzy weight and a hint of hardness.  Pleasant enough. **

Yeasty, quite meaty. Rich. Needs a few years.  I haven't had a recently purchased bottle of Pol for a while and was surprised by its weight. Good though. ***
Lovely sous-bois and blackberry  nose,  silky fruit, ripe (in the modern style) with succulent, tannins.   Rather classy in a fairly modern way. (A quick thrash onGoogle reveals this one some sort of IWC trophy - I can understand that.)  Not entirely my sort of thing but still perhaps worth a bare ***(*)
Iodine and iron, rich, decadent, fleshy.  Fruitcake fruit.   Good, and time to drink. Bare ****

Tight acidity, fine and intense.  I've been a bit up-and-down about this wine but I'm sure I like this bottle. Perhaps even ****
Quite big, a touch flabby, rather evolved and vegetal. I'm not sure what combination of producer, vintage and possibly premature oxidation accounts for this, being unfamiliar with the first two factors in this case.   Still pretty drinkable.  Bare ***
Lightweight, feminine and fragrant although with quite a hard core running through it that suggests drinking with food.  Modest acidity, and so I am not sure how long this is for keeping.  Very pleasant but without real distinction at the highest level. Top ***
Not very striking.  **
Herby nose, quite tight and nicely balanced for the vintage. ***
Juicy, succulent, a touch of minerality.  Very good: drinking but will probably improve a bit yet.  ***
An attractive combionation of piquant high-toned fruit with a lovely rounded ripeness.  Very good - for drinking over the next few years, I think. Top ***
(Domaine de la Bon Gran) Rather rich, touch of botrytis probably, pretty good. ***
Really nice - quite forward as the producers wines tend to be, quite big but in balance.   No hint of the problems of the vintage.  Top ***
The second bottle of H. Lignier 1er cru from this vintage I have tried recently.  This is so pure, digestible and generally fine, but understated - it doesn't shout and it doesn't have a particular note of individuality for me.   Yet it is a complete wine that I like a lot.   Beginning to drink well, but not a long-haul wine.   Top ***

Notably off-dry still, very fresh with rounded, attractive fruit. Good. ***
Lovely apple and cream nose, slightly honied and a touch of yeast.  Fine mousse too. Lovely.  A 93/94/95 blend I believe.   Top ****
That old Rioja nose of nuts and mushrooms and something slightly medical - lovely. Very fresh, nicely rounded fruit.  Ultimately I suppose not complex enough to be a great wine but rather good. Bare ****
Good intensity, the fruit has a distinct character: mineral, not fruit-driven, something almost secondary about what is surely primary fruit.  Very engaging.  Top ***
Very gentle, completely resolved, pleasantly enjoyable. ***
All very lovely, but despite the deftness of the touch of new barriques, I feel it lacks the crystaline purity of his other wines. ***
An enigma: that slightly "flat" souuthern-French palate, but with air an engaging herby nose. Is it going anywhere?  I'm not sure. Top **
Lovely cherry fruit. Very attractive. ***
Good Syrah character, fruit-driven but not to the point of undrinkability.  Pleasant. Scrapes **
Substantial and weighty, notable botrytis, interesting palate but perhaps tending towards rustic.  This was just a taste -I'd be interested to try more. ***
Fruit still has a lot of primary blackcurrant but the structure seems resolved so I guess this is for drinking now.  Creamy, some cigar-box, all in all attractive fruit, but a little too undemanding to rate a really high score. Top ***
I guess I could get used to this trocken business:  this has good fruit and is bone-dry without being harsh.  Still fairly moderate alcohol at 12%, the overall balance is good.  A year or two short of its peak, I suspect. ***
Blackberry fruit, some oak I think - quite tannic perhaps from the oak. Modern-style. **
An interesting expression of the Langhe, if with a modern tinge of new oak. Everything Conterno makes iselegan and drinkable and this is no exception. On the other hand I can't feel it is ultimately distinguished in the way that his Barolos are.  A mix of four grape varietoes including Nebbiolo. Bare ***
Round berry fruit, quite a lot of blackcurrant, some tobacco.   Very nice mature Claret, if tending slightly towards the rustic - lacks the fineness of a top wine. Good though. ***
Quite spritzy initially but the next day that had dissipated and the honeysuckle Soave charcter and pure fruit very evident.  Good length too. Top **(*)
This is better every time I try it - class will out and I think it is Le Mesnil fruit that is giving it such minerality and complexity. Delicious. ****
My last bottle of this.  It's really a relaxed, fully mature, attractive and balanced wine.  Enough complexity to be interesting and the primary fruit that I remember being rather excessive years ago is now nicely in balance.  Very good.  I notice in passing that it is a relativel modest 12.5% alcohol. ***
Very classy, pure, blackberry and apple fruit.   Demanding but ripe tannins, very succulent.   Really good Dolcetto. ***
Spritzy from dissolved CO2 I guess.  Excellent richness of fruit, intensity and length.   Nice sweetness balanced by really good acidity. At least ***(*)
Lovely bright appetising Mosel wine, yet with a rich fruitiness. Very attractive. Top ***
The second time I've tried this recently.  It's an Ozzie-like Cabernet Syrah blend but with a very unozzie dry palate.   Seems to get better the longer it is open. Fine wine. ***
A dry dark Oloroso-like palate - what a P.C. ought to have I guess but I often find them more Amontillado there too as well as on the nose.  Rather good.  15 years old according to their web site.   Top ***

Spicy riesling petrolly nose. Pretty dry - good length.  But fairly simple and light.   *
Again petrolly - rather richer.   Quite good concentration. Dry.  I wonder how this will go given it is already so petrolly.  **
Honey and caramel. Butter.  Less intense on the palate. Good **
Less ambitious and benefits from that - in fact reasonably concentrated and intense. ***
Unusually intense vanilla nose. Damp straw - quite heavy-textured.  **
Honied and rich. Charred nose and oily fruit.  Big and long.  Impressive in its way (which is not my way). Bare ***
Berry nose.  Oddly rasping finish. **
Minty.  Similar - finishes a bit abruptly.  **
Minty.   A bit toffeed. High-toned. I'm not wild about this.   **
Liquor blackberries. Medium-weight palate - oddly bitter finish. Might be going to be rather good. (I keep getting this wine in situations where I can't sit back,drink a couple of glasses and think about it.  I must try and do that at some point.) ***
Dry, pure, well-made. Balanced. ***
Liquour raspberry again.  A bit thick. Softer and lacking the attack of the 2001. **
Hints at mint again.  Oddly twisty. Yet more balanced than the Chileans. **
Quite fresh, fruity, straw-like. High-toned. Rather nice.  ***
Pleasant and gracefully old - perhaps going a bit flat.  Top **
I spent the day moving paving slabs (heavy and intense) and making fish stock (light and intense). The stock was poured over some cod, sea bass, spinach and creme fraiche (this isn't Fine Wine Dairy, but it does pay to get decent creme fraiche) and then baked in the oven with a little grated parmesan. Stroganoff, excellent cheeses from the Cambridge Cheese Company and a passion fruit tart from Maison Blanc in Oxford (that my daughter was very passionate about) followed.
Good fizz which is perhaps just beginning to tire. Medium weight and with a hint of oxidation. Top ***
Rather simple after the de Venoge - lighter weight. Some complexity emerges after a while in the glass. ***
This was the sort of bottle you would avoid even on the most generous of bin-end offers: the label stained and some evidence that the wine was seeping through the cork and dribbling down the capsule. However, the wine inside was lovely. This was as tight a Riesling as you could hope to taste with classic minerality and finely tuned acidity. A really fine effort with time ahead. ***(*)
One of those wines where the first sniff tells you that you are in the presence of something special. Glorious sweet St Julien fruit with a palate that is on first taste deceptively simple. None of the typical Talbot whiff of the barnyard' that Broadbent notes, but rather, on this showing, a wine of great purity and lasting structure. Superb, and at a glorious peak. *****
From magnum. I guess this was always going to be a come down after the previous wine (I rather naughtily tasted them in this order when others at the table were more conventional in their drinking order). This is reliable stuff that is drinking well with its tarry, coffee and chocolate overtones. Good claret that, enjoyable though it is (I am drinking it whilst typing these notes), gets relegated, for now, to the luncheon division. A good ***
From a half. Delicious and aging rather well. Good apricoty acidity and with a sweetness that is verging on being oversweet, but which is contained within the framework of the wine. I think this will age into something truly great. ****(*)

Showing its age with a tendency towards maderisation but very drinkable with yeasty rich fruit and good length. ****
Like a Viognier almost, nicely intense. Top **
Pure black-cherry fruit in profusion. Good concentration and so on, with a slightly cassis character that seems quite common in modern wines.  How will this age I wonder? Probably quite well although the whole package is a bit soft for my taste.  Top ***
Fragrant, lightweight (a very poor vintage of course), no very great length, needs drinking soon but it still has lovely minerality and is very stylish.  Top ***
Meatier, longer and generally a bit more substantial than the 93 with a slight bitterness on the finish that will probably ease further although the wine must be close to peak. Again so individual and so much a terroir wine.  I love it. Bare ****
Backward, dense but fragrant and long.  Coming towards peak.   Really lovely. ****(*)
This has rather a baked fruit character that I am not so keen on.  It is hard to taste against great wines like the Gentaz, but only a top **
Fragrant, dry and long.  More mineral and complex than the other Ogier wines.   Really lovely and should be drunk on its own away from the Gentaz wines that tend to upstage it. ****
An absolute star that could even benefit from another year or two.  Tremendous weight, and concentrated minerality but all in balance.  Fantastic.  Top *****
Needs a swirl or two in the glass but characteristic Cote Rotie violets emerge.   Very good. Top ***
This has a solid core of fruit, and the minerality and complexity that all the wines possess. It is a touch harder and a touch less strong all round than the 89 however. Bare *****
Fragrant, balanced, easy-going wine with a nice dry finish. Good ***
Corked. Not Rated
Awkwardly dry and rather short.  Would go down quite well with food perhaps but not great - hardly surprising given the vintage. Top **
Asian spices (as R.P. so often says).  Fresh (almost youthful still) with fantastically long fruit. Gorgeous. Top *****
Oxidised - might be an odd bottle so I won't rate it but of course at this age from this vintage they might all be this way. Not Rated
More awkward than the 85 - it lacks that wines easy balance. But this is really complex and the minerality is perhaps even more pronounced. Intellectual wine and really good. *****
More open and leafy, lacks the poise of the best vintages but does give a long mineral mouthful. ****
Top stuff but a little flabby and keroseney for a special cuvee from this producer. Top ***
Mineral, broad, intense with a restrained, crystalline purity.  Brilliant. *****

Pale tangerine colour in a decanter.  Intensely gingery on the nose (as Ramonet's wines often are) but to a grotesque degree.  Rather horrible palate - probably just oxidised but in a rather odd way.  A day later the oxidation aspect less apparent but still extravagently gingery and with a dull flatness. No Stars
Much more what one expects - plenty of acid, quite juicy, nice fruit. ***
Quite leafy  liquid tobacco.   This seems to have gone backwards a bit since I last tasted it - clearly needs a few years but good drinking now too. ***(*)

According to the front label 'An original blend of 95% SYRAH'; according to the back label a 'wonderful accompaniment to chicken dishes, goat's cheese tart or full flavoured cheeses' and 'Suitable for vegetarians and vegans'. Unlike the labelling, the wine isn't too contrived. Good balance and good red fruit depth. It will probably improve with a few years age. By the way, the other 5% is Mouvedre [sic]. Just **(*)
I wasn't expecting much of this - Sunday evening combined with a general foreboding about white Rhones. What a revelation though! Glorious full bodied stuff with a lovely toffee and honeysuckle length to the palate. A wine I could drink and drink - and not just on Sundays. ****

Good old fizz with touches of honey, wood and aniseed. Medium bodied and with the acidity to keep the mature flavours together. ****
A disappointing wine in some sense. Quite winey, and doesn't really have the class one expects. Relatively (for a big name from '96) rather simple and lacking the drama and complexity of something to tuck away for the future. Possibly an off form bottle. **(*)

Exotic, rich, old-fashioned. Splendid. ***
Peachy, exotic, quite evolved.   Made to drink fairly young, but has that Grand Cru something about it. Bare  ****
So floral, pure and beautiful. Intense, dry.  Approachable but lots of underlying structure. Completely gorgeous. *****(*)
Mineral, very attractive, drinking nicely.   ***
Rounder and a bit more concentrated.  Mineral finish.  Very good.  Still fairly young. ***(*)
Much more reserved.  Dense.  Very concentrated - more balanced than the 90.  Brilliant.  ***(**)
Leaner, sea breezes.  Very classic.  Lovely.  (In time the 89 will be the better wine I guess.) ****(*)
Lighter nose.  Edgy finish.  Not a bad 78. ***
Not edgy like the last time.  Very fine.  Piquant.  Complex.  Very classic. *****
Thanks to everybody for bringing interesting and enjoyable wines, and to Centotre for feeding us well.
Dry,  rich, appetising. Long. Pretty  nice.  I feel a bit of barrique aging is aiming at an international market, but it is good.   I'd like to sit down and drink a few glasses one evening.   Maybe even scrapes  ***
Quite Burgundian weight. Oaky (but quite well handled) Chardonnay.  Classy - needs time though.   I find the Tunina a bit more individual but this is pretty good.  Bare ***(*)
As usual, a melange of flavours.  Delicious.   Bare ****
Turkish Delight.  Dry.   Could be a bit tiring although perhaps Gewurz is ever that way.  Nice balance of rose-scented fruit with a dry palate.  Good length. Another wine I'dlike to try "properly".  A good ***

Herby.  Good balance.  Very drinkable.   ***
Suave, silky, dry.  Quite structured.  Easy **(*)
A bit dry - might improve but seems a bit austere.  But rather a nice nose.   **(*)
Scented nose but tannic.   Serious, I find the new oak tannins a bit more difficult young than the traditional style.  But the oak is done well and terroir shows through.  Pretty concentrated - fine wine.  This has quite a lot of quality and might evolve well in a Sandrone sort of way.   **(**)
Light elegant, quite fine.  I feel I've had slightly better bottles of this.  Top ***
More body but perhaps a touch less well delineated than the Sandrone.   Very nice approaching maturity.  Bare ****
So delicate, mineral, fine and long.  Just ready.  *****
A bit extracted and a bitter for my palate.  Not my sort of thing, although there's alot of wine in the glass.   Perhaps I might warm to it with more time.   Good **
Dry, savoury, cooked fruits.  Mushrooms, nuts.  Really good Amarone.  Maybe even ***(*)
Nice way to finish - well-balanced and delicious. Top ***

Dry, juicy, mineral, nicely made.  A bit thin on the mid-palate initially but it fills out with time.  Nice.  Bare ***(*)
A bit more modern-styled.  Pleasantly creamy.  ***
Good farmyardy, mature Burgundy - quite piquant and perhaps a touch rough with marked tannins.  Nice drinking but fades a little in the glass. ***

Rather dilute, dull and uninteresting. *
Past it - horrible. No Stars
A bit tough and tannic, but with good texture. Could do with a bit more fruit. More drinkable than I thought it would be. **

Not a star village, an un-rated vineyard and a moderate vintage - it's amazing what sensitive winemaking can achieve.  Lovely, drinkable, engaging, characterful and not entirely simple fuit - nine years old and about at peak from a half.  Really very enjoyable. ***
Dense colour.  Quite Syrah-like at first, but more baked (almost burnt) plum fruit after a while.   Good texture - feels nice in the mouth.  Good structure too - this is a rather good, characterful wine.   Still improving and needing time, but perhaps it won't actually quite rate more stars. ***
Really quite youthful still, high-toned food wine with a touch of (very Italian) bitterness. Nice fruit.   I described this as "modern" last time I drank it, but it isn't evolving quickly. Merits ***
A big hit of blackcurrant on the nose initially - and a while after it still has quite a lot of forward fruit, at least compared to the more austere higher-toned 94.  Still a fine wine but I'm having trouble getting to grips with it.   Say, ***
Lovely high-toned brambly fruit with a touch of cranberry.  Good ripeness and succulent tannins, nice mineral base too  - probably still improving and could even rate another star in time. For now a top  ***
My last bottle of this: rich and flavoursome with highly evolved fruit - on my first sip I thought it was past its best, but on longer acquaintance I felt it was about at its best while needing drinking relatively soon.  Top ***
Healthy colour - cedary, fruitcake nose and a pleasantly balanced palate. Pretty much at peak, but holding nicely - a bit of air and it opens up and reveals a fragrant side too.  I haven't always been overwhelmed by the wines from this estate, but this has shifted my opinion up a bit. ***
Very pleasantly cedary, but this Bordeaux-style wine's fruit is becoming a bit thin now.  **
My last bottle of this: lemony vanilla, touch of sherry character but completely and enjoyably fresh and appetising.   Almost timeless, but I guess it wouldn't improve.   Very pleasant mature wine (of an unfashionable sort). ***
Scented, dry and savoury - old-fashioned Claret that isn't that weighty. Very pleasant, but I think perhaps not one of the best wines from this property - it is still improving but may not rate more stars. ***
I haven't tasted this for eight years, I think.   I rated it very highly then as a young wine and now it has a restrained but lovely old apricot nose and a wonderful density of fruit of fruit and a rich, extravagently viscous texture. There's a nice level of acidity too that stops it cloying and a very long finish.   Very lovely, but I have slight reservations about the complexity -  it does seem, as one might perhaps expect from the grape, a touch one-dimensional given its other qualities. ****
My first sampling of Jadot's Beaujolais project.  My first thought was that I was expecting something a bit larger, but the fruit has good, under-stated concentration and there is an attractive mineral core too.  Very drinkable, yet there is a tannic underpinning that will give a at least a few years of positive evolution.   I am quite positive about htis - for now a conservative **(*)
Lovely, intense, Grenache-based wine - long, balanced, like a very good Chateauneuf. Easy top ***
The Lamaione is a disappointing wine. I remember having it for the fist time (before FWD, in 1995 or earlier I guess). Then it oozed class, and in 1997 I still rated it highly. But since then it has declined, and now one word will do: 'undrinkable' - although I've expanded slightly beyond that below. I wonder whether its earlier showing was flattered by some flashy wine making (carb. mac.?). There aren't many wines I've poured down the sink, but this was one of them.
Harsh and astringent. Completely gone. No Stars
I don't want to be unfair to this wine (it was a quick replacement for the undrinkable Lamaione), but this isn't quite of the standard that previous vintages of this wine used to be - although, possibly, it is just a bit closed. *
A really good bottle of this wine - it seems in the past to have varied between 3 and 4 stars. This one had the good strawberry leather nose of the best bottles. ****
Leathery, rustic and farmyardy. Not the most elagent wine ever, but it never has been. Just ****

Touch of toast, nice middle of the road Champagne palate, medium weight, decent finish. ***
Quite vinous nose.  Chewy palate with some obvious wood influence.  Good length. Top ***
Elegant, ripe apples, fine, long finish. Excellent fine mousse. Not universally enjoyed, perhpas becaus it could do with some time in bottle. I like the style though. Scrapes ****
Seems good but very slightly tainted - corked maybe, but perhaps in fact excess sulphur. Takes the edge off.   Not Rated
Dry, fragrant, nice balance.  ***
Very toasty - one gets used to it. Very tightly elegant and fine but it lacks sensory oomph a bit even though it is seriously concentrated.   Loses fizz quite quickly.  I have slightly mixed feelings about this but maybe it needs further study.  Top ****
Quite full-bodied - a touch rustic perhaps.  There is something of Macon-with-bubbles about it but nevertheless it's very drinkable. Good ***
Some lovely wine, but also some disappointments. I've had Talbot, Gruaud Larose and Las Cases 1982 in the last few months, and whilst the first two have been stunning; the last one is not showing well.
Lovely together fizz - good acidity - elegant. ****
Delicious weighty wine with a good, heavy acidity. Stunning. *****
Lovely Riesling nose - elegant palate - acidity variable, but the wine isn't getting flabby. ***
Good wine with food (garlic and chilli prawns), but a bit simple. ***
Dry finish - unknit - not really clear whether it has a direction. ***
Dusty and drying out. **
Good but closed. **(*)
Drinking beautifully. Easily the claret of the evening for drinking now. Textbook Pauillac at a peak. ****
Disappointing. A touch volatile at the end. Weighty, but it should be better than this. ***
Good wine which others preferred more than me. Big and balanced. ***
From a half. Good botrytis, but the acidity is lacking. Too heavily sweet for my tastes. ***

The last time I had this, in 2002, it seemed a weedy wine that probably wasn't going to live to its youthful potential. It just had the odd glimpse suggesting it might improve - but I wasn't that convinced. Fortunately though, this bottle at least is on lovely form. A dry wine without flashiness, but lovely toned acidity and flavours that are constantly developing in the glass. And to think that I almost decided to drink all my bottles in 2002. An easy ****
Holding up well, but so dull compared with  the Chateauneuf above. Simple sweet flavours. I suppose ***

Attractive nutty (marzipan?), tangy  nose, very nicely-textured palate with solid underlying fruit and a lovely salty finish.  All quite refined.   Maybe scrapes ****
Not what I expected on opening, oddly rounded fruit and a tired feeling.  After a while though it opens up quite nicely: bone-dry, savoury, citric, a touch of herbs and a hint of Fino Sherry.  Very nice and perhaps will even improve. For now ***
Very luxurious agreeable Oloroso that slips down a treat without generating the last word in excitement although its nose is pretty complex at least soon after opening.  Say ***
This wine has a touch of the lifted salty tang of Manzanilla over a burnt old-wine palate with a long finish. Very mouthwatering, a touch of camphor or something.   Seems almost better after a day or two open.   Very lovely. Easy ****
Very fine and long - tangy, hints of chocolate almost on the nose.   Not quite as demanding as the Coliseo from this house but very fine. ****
Very drinkabe old sherry, grippy and with that nice hint of sourness.   Not the last word in fineness however - I feel this hints a bit at dry-cleaning fluid. ***
Rich and long with rather greater depth than a standard Fino - salty tang too, nice acidity and a long, citric finish.  Very clean and pure. ***

Not quite one thing or the other if you know what I mean. Vibrant ripe fruit to start with but with a green and dilute finish. Not as interesting as I would have hoped. **

Good fruit but perhaps a touch rustic - old straw farmyard characters of a pleasant sort.   Completely mature and very drinkable. Forgiving it a certain rusticity one might stretch to ****
Warm and ripe (the vintage I guess) but perhaps beginning to lose it in a graceful way. Cedary but not terribly complex. Bare ***
Seems pretty much ready to drink - nice balance, generous fruit and a nice dry finish.   Bare ****
Lovely appetising, drinkable wine (breaking for another mouthful as I type).   Not a hint of the varietal flab, yet lovely ripe fruit and mineral overtones. Something of almonds about the whole package too.  This has the balance to keep well for a while I feel, and it may even improve over a year or so.  Dry yet not austere, and with really good length.  Classy. ***

Clean, fresh and simple wine with lightweight raspberry fruit. **
A touch oxidised, but I couldn't decide whether this was the winemaking or a duff bottle. So, until I get to try it again Not Rated

From a magnum. Good sweet fruit, chocolate and coffee. Good balance for drinking now. Top ***

Bone dry and with good intensity and length.   It just seems to lack a bit of pizzaz - the whole effect is a touch (but just a touch)  flat. ***
Silky-textured and rich,  one feels this wine is part of the transition to a modern style here.  But this has produced a fine wine in this vintage, voluptuous, but still with enough stuffing. ***
Nice mature riesling nose - completely resolved and really quite soft and lovable. Top ***
I have mixed feelings about this: on the plus side, fine nettle-like fruit, nicely balanced, now mature with a decent finish and a streak of minerality; on the minus side a slight lack of real presence,  just a little underwhelming considering the reputation of the producer.  Scrapes ***
It's easy to scoff at Musar, and until today I hadn't opened one of my own bottles for a year or two, but it's really not half bad you know.  Rustic, yes - ultimately fairly simple, yes - but it does have lovely round, sweet, leathery fruit and it has aged very gracefully to a soft, amber-edged maturity.  So it's easy to scoff in the other sense too. ***
Some will say this is past its peak but I rather like it. Mature riesling apricot flavours, old wine roundedness, very pleasant. ***
Quite big, ripe and sweet for spatlese.  Very attractive, quite forward and engaging fruit.  Very good rather than really riveting. Top ***
Quite big, ripe and rich.  This has a timeless quality - while showing some mature characters it is still quite sweet and very fresh - it will benefit from more time in bottle I think and will probably merit 4 stars in the long run.  Impressive. ***(*)
Remeniscent of a top Rhone Grenache: high-toned, a touch medicinal.   This is really good wine - intense fruit but a nice balance. Top ***
This has now opened up nicely - gorgeous long, mouthfilling greengage fruit.   It was so tight a few years ago and it has been fascinating to watch its progress.  It is bone dry and has that Wachau sternness that (slightly to my surprise) I am often a bit ambivalent about.  This though is drinking so nicely - perhaps it's just a mistage to try and drink these wines young.  Very top ***
This seems to have become a touch more piquant and high-toned than I recall.  A grown-up's wine with tanins that might never be entirely mellow until too late, and a classic Claret nose.  Lovely.  top ***
Sherberty, very open fruit, and very pleasantly drinkable at 8% alcohol.   A bit spritzy at first and ever so slightly hollow on the palate, if I was going to criticise. On the other hand, it has a lovely long finish.   Ready to drink I guess, but no great hurry.  Lovely. Top ***
Raspberry fruit, nodding at cassis also, dry, very firm as this producers wines tend to be - still a touch hard.  Very nice village wine coming round as it approaches its 10th birthday. ***
Rather nice - intense grapefruity riesling, with something towards nectarine on a persistant finish.  Seems quite dry to me for a classic-style Rheingau but that may partly be the particularly good acidity.   Drinking nicely but no hurry to consume - might even be better in a few years.  Top ***
A high-toned wine from this most European-styled of Californian winemakers, with rich yet piquant fruit.  This will improve a bit I suspect but needs the right food.  Bare ***
Seven year-old Soave? The fruit is now rather evolved - peach kernels and almonds, but still fresh and with a hint of floral notes on the nose.  Some will say this is past its best but I like it a lot.  Dry, attractive, drinkable. A good ***
Dry, yet with with very nicely-textured fruit.  A bargain at well the right side of a tenner. **
Pleasant. **
Nice example, without any great extra complexity. Top **

Red Burgundy Wine as it helpfully says on the label. Rather dilute and lacking. Possibly just too old. *
Sweeter fruit than the above, and with a simple charm. But hard work finding much flavour. **
A  bit unripe on the palate, and with coarse fruit. Some (pleasant) signs of  maturity on the nose, but not coordinated with the rest of the wine. **
Easily the best of the recent Pinots that I've had. A touch stewed, but at least not suffering the dilute characters of the two French wines. ***

Medium depth, well put together for early drinking. Reasonably taut. ***
Liquorice and black cherry nose. Charming for early drinking. ***

Occasional glimpses of bacon fat and raspberry, but some coarseness and awkwardness. **
A slight spritz on opening. Lihtly honeyed and with hints of blanched almonds. ***

Sherberty rich,  drinking very nicely as it has for a while and will for a few years yet. Long and delicious. Top ***
Rounded, forward fruit - pleasant but  ultimately fairly simple. Bare ***
Rather overwrought - huge alcohol - rather flabby fruit (although superficially there's decent acidity). A substantial wine that perhaps I just wasn't in the mood for.  Top **
Gamy, rustic, high-quality fruit.   Interesting, quite complex, characterful.  Guessed this might be Swan. Top ***
Good fruit.  Nicely balanced.  Good concentration.  Good ***
Baked, tarry fruit.  Very tannic - serious (perhaps overly so).  Others will admire this more than me.  ***
Jammy, solid,  quite raisiny.  Very substantial wine - I find it a touch heavy going at the moment.  I suspect it will improve and be rather impressive. ***(*)
Refined, concentrated,  almost high-toned.  Just beginning to drink well.  Lovely.  ****
Nice - similar in style but a shade weaker all round.  Good ***
Very dark colour.  Very marmaladey.  Ultimately not so complex and clearly upstaged by the Filhot.  ***
Light colour but in fact quite botrytised.  Quite high-toned.   Grippy.  A very good wine for the property.   ****
Very pruney and rich.   Really appealing fruit with some hot edges.  Probably for drinking now, and pretty pleasant in its way.  ***
A bit drier and more mainstream.   Still a shade closed,  very good.  Bare ***(*)

Possibly seems a bit older than it is. Good acidity and some tannin at the end of a fairly full bodied, old-fashioned entrance. Needs some time to resolve itself. ****(*)
More floral and open than the last bottle I had of this. Well made fizz for drinking young. ***
Fairly vinous and with good, sharply focused acidity at the end. A champagne that tastes like a good young fizzy Burgundy. This needs time, and could be stunning. ***(**)
Possibly not in the best of condition compared with a recent bottle that Toby had. The flavours are a bit dull and it is more oxiidative than might be expected. Not Rated

Weighty, meaty nose - autolytic plus apples.   Similarly with the palate, but not at the expense of balance.  Apples again, a suggestion of tannins.  Long, quite complex, perhaps a touch young - I'm sure a year or two in cellar will be beneficial.  Scrapes ***(*)
Really quite forward - touch of vanilla - long and enjoyable but doesn't seem to have the guts to be a real keeper.  Bare ****
Only a year or two delayed versus the standard vintage. Still very fresh, nutty and autolytic - really yeasty on the nose.   Drier and tighter than the GA 97 too - lower dosage probably and perhaps the vintage too. Complex finish.  Lovely. Scrapes  *****
Red wine made from Pinot Noir, of course. Fairly complex nose, bone dry - seems a bit flat and old on the mid-palate. All the interest is on the nose.  Rather dull in the mouth.  If fizz could be made with these grapes, then this is a bit of a waste except that it gives some insight into the nature of fruit that makes good Champagne.   Bare **
Very mushroom and truffle - and hinting at maderisation.  Curious indeed,  and not entirely positively. Old beyond its years - is it an odd bottle? The guy from Bollinger says not, but seemed to have decided this before nosing mine.  Perhaps having this after desert was a poor idea (I did think of leaving my pud until later) and I wouldn't be surprised if there is more to this wine than I found.  For now, the interest on the nose scrapes ****

Lovely delicate summer drinking with almond and white fruit flavours. ***

Lovely delicate summer drinking with almond and white fruit flavours. ***

Fragrant, mellow, eminently drinkable.  Fresh but a suspicion of drying at the end suggests this is not for keeping beyond another five or so years. ***
High-toned, a bit of cranberry, a touch of underlying meatiness and excellent fruit.  Lovely but without the va-va-voom of the Combe aux Moins from the same producer and vintage tasted recently.  Still scrapes ***(*)
Lively, quite complex, proper tarry Barolo and more or less "a point".  A bit coarse-textured to be worth more than ***
The things one finds when cataloguing the cellar - an auction purchase of a couple of bottles I seem to recall.  I opened one with trepidation but no need: actually a healthy light colour and a lovely, fresh, tar and roses Barolo nose.  The fruit had that underlying sweetness that good Barolo has and which with the fragrance sets off the firmness of even mature tannins.   Not terribly complex but really very enjoyable drinking.   ***
I have oscillated a bit about this 100% Gargenega wine.   It is Ca Rugate's interpretation of what old Soave might have been like, I seem to recall.   It has a deep colour (from skin contact, I think) and a broad, flat, mouthfilling palate after a honeysuckle nose. It reminds me a bit of one or two other Italian producers who are pushing things in a similar direction: Massa Vecchia and Gravner.   It is rather less grand than either (and a bit cheaper)  but I like it, and I think time is making it more interesting. ***
Intense strawberry nose, solid, concentrated  fruit, quite dry as often with Lafarge. A touch of Italianate bitterness and quite firm tannins make it rather a food wine at the moment.   I hope that rawness wears off - I think it will.   ***(*)
Surprisingly high-toned almost Amontillado-like nose. Palate has warm raisiny character and a nice texture. ***
Very pure, raspberry fruit.  Now completely resolved and drinking very nicely. I think it lacks the real edge of terroir at this stage, or something to add complexity.   Drinking pretty nicely however. ***
Smoky raspberry fruit, begining to show its age a bit but still fresh.  Very drinkable but not super-exciting. ***
Quite fat and mouthfilling - I haven't drunk this producers wines or Chablis from this vintage much so I'm not sure about the cause of this rather atypical richness.   Still, this has a lovely honey-influenced palate and enough underlying minerality to be very enjoyable. Absolutely at peak.  From a half.   Top ***
I seem to remember having mixed feelings about a bottle of this, but this one is lovely - completely drinkable medicinally-edged concentrated Grenache. Excellent. ***
Herbs and spices, with rounded green-pea and other vegetal flavours.  Quite individual but really, really  good. ****
Another 96 from my cellar, opened partly to illuminate the controversy about this vintage.  Healthy colour, fine fruit, creamy texture and excellent acidity.  This seems just a touch subdued right now but is definitely very good. ***(*)

Very bright and mouthwatering, pure attractive fruit and some tannic backbone.  Very good. ****
Not a flashy, rowdy 82 but I feel perhaps that in avoiding that the wine lacks the definition or complexity to be better than very good.  Fine wine, starting to drink well, but a little less than one might hope for given the property and the vintage. ****

Curiously charred and smoky at first but that blows off - presumably not overly toasted barrels then.  A lovely, irony mature Claret with succulent fruit emerges.  Delicious drinking. ****

Fine - elegantly balanced and good length.  Refined blanc de blancs.   Could do with a year or so in bottle perhaps but lovely. Top ***

A really good bottle of one of these recently disgorged wines (that canbe a little variable).  Tjis one with lovely autolytic flavours and honey over lovely fresh fruit.  Quite nicely rounded, but no hint of flab. *****
Quite austere and even a touch awkward right now but with lots of character.  Perhaps it will be more easy-going in a year or two, but good now with the right food. ***
Quite forward for Maume - the vintage perhaps although the attractive ripe fruit is not at the expense of enough backbone for development for a few tears.  Really very nice drinking Burgundy. ***
(I think I have remembered the vintage correctly.) Nice, well-made dessert wine. **
A welcome 'win' for a white Burgundy, and a good Swiss chardonnay. As for the Zinfandels, It confirmed my view that I don't want flashy vibrant stuff - I want something with more complexity along the Ridge lines.
Good if not dramatic fizz. ***
Nice acidity - honeyed with minor age. Lovely texture. ****
Butter and hazelnuts, but the age is showing possibly a bit more than is ideal. ***
Soft and dilute. All over the place. **

Big, vibrant  and zingy, but a bit short. Became toffeed in the glass. ***
Vibrant and in a dry style - needs a bit more time possibly. **(*)
More complexity than the others, and to my mind a better style of wine for it - smooth rather than vibrant. A touch of  volatility. ****
Vegetal and astringent - all over the place. I think this wine had a synthetic cork.  Poor. **
Leafy and some tannin. Simple and falls apart. **
Sweet, but a bit lacking in acidity. Some grip. ***

Yeasty, quite fragrant. Slightly toffeed fruit. Quite decent length.  Some might say tired but I find this rather good. Not often one has a Swiss wine! **

Confusion marketing I feel.  This wine sells for a tiny bit more and has quite a lot of added richness.  I'd pay the extra every time. ***

Understated, dry (none of that fatness the village wine has) lots of Puligny character. Good balance and excellent length. **(**)
Rounder and more easy-going than the Perrieres. Still good balance and a fine wine, but this can happily be drunk now although surely it will improve a touch. ***(*)
Nicely made Meursault, nice balance, although perhaps with an air of being what it is: a very good village wine and without 1er cru distinction. Bare ***
Charcterful, gutsy Meursuault with a bit of bitterness on the finish that I'm not sure I like so much. Perhaps this will depart with a year or two in bottle. For now, judgement reserved. Not Rated
A bit richer and broader with good length.  Very nice. ***
A special selection, I think and notably more expensive. Quite serious, concentrated fruit and good structure and so you get what you pay for. ***
A bit clarety - fruit tending toward cassis and some wood influence, I think. Pleasant enough. **

Rather charmingly fragrant nose of violets. Modern Chianti for drinking young. ***
Easy, clean Burgundy without huge depth but with purity of fruit. ***
An intersting comparsion wine to the earlier Chianti. This is more robust and has a slight bitterness to the fruit. Holding up well, and probalbly needs more time. ****

Very graceful, almondy nose - slightly floral, but pleasingly free of overt varietal statement.  (I think it's a blend of various varieties, for what it's worth.)  On the palate, completely balanced with perfect acidity and a touch of ripe lemon around a concentrated but understated palate.  Very fine.  ****
Seems quite oxidatively made. Stony, meaty rather than elegant.  Pretty nice but not out of this world. ***
Good colour, black-cherry nose.  Fruit quite baked in character and at first it seems to have a hole in the mid-palate.  But that seemed to fill in once the bottle had been open a while.   Chunky and without the complexity to be really classy.  ***
Dense young colour and intense black cherry and cough-sweet nose.   Despite the concentration of fruit it's very silky on the palate with a background of ripe tannins.   Very luscious.  Seems almost less approachable the next day, which is a bit frightening.   Top stuff. ****(*)
A long maceration job, in the style of Gravner,  but from Garganega from Gambellara just outside Soave.   Deeply coloured but slightly cloudy, with a flat peachy nose.   Slight spritz on the fruit.

Not a property I've drunk much recently and it used to be a bit of a joke for producing "Englishman's Claret".  They've done quite well in this vintage though: quite powerful and structured, good fruit, drinkable now but probably more so in a couple of years.   Good at the price.  **(*)
Lovely, vibrant,  deep pink colour.  Once open for a quarter of an hour, a delicious nose of strawberry fruit.  Quite vinous - like a substantial still rose rather than Champagne with a touch of colour.   Long finish.   Will probably benefit from a year or two in bottle.  Top ***

Talento is apparantly a trademark of a consortium of growers in Northern Italy making Methode Champenoise fizz from mainly Champagne grapes.   This is made by Prosecco producer Bisol.   It has the charcteristic yeasty character, fine fruit, it's dry but not over-austere.  Nice - it might make an interesting ringer in a flight of growers Champagnes.  ***

Fresh, strawberry and redcurrant flavours with good balancing acidity and a touch of eldeflower. Good, easy drinking for a summer's evening. **

Frizzante, only 6.5% alcohol, pleasantly refreshing.  Rather like a Moscato but floral rather than grapey.  It says "dolce" on the corner of the label - it's about demi-sec and nicely in balance of rthe style.  Ideal for sunny garden evenings.  Well made. **
Rather good fruit, oak fairly evident on the palate but probably not excessive (although I must say I like less and less oak in my wines),  quite mineral too.  Could do with a bit longer in bottle but probably won't make four stars as it seems just a bit simple by the highest standards. ***
It's sad, but Waitrose is much better than any previous source of fruit and veg in the city.
Toffee and caramel, quite maderised and a bit vegetal but maintaining interest and drinkability despite being past its best.  I oscillate between finding this too far-gone and admiring it.  A reminder of what over-old white Burgundy should be like, as compared to the current rash of prematurely oxidised wines that are simply rotting.   Some will find this unappetising but I'll settle on **

The friends very kindly came with two bottles of Champagne - one a back-up bottle in case the main one wasn't showing well.
Possibly just past its peak, but a nice wine for those who like their Champagne old (which I do). OK, 1990 isn't that old, but this isn't the greatest name in Champagne either. Good, slightly oxidised maturity with the 1990s softness evident. ***
This bottle has been shouting 'drink me, drink me!' for the last couple of years - eyeing me up each time I opened the cellar. I had it last in 1999, when it was disappointing. This time though it was a glorious claret with warm, pencil-shaving nose and palate. I'm glad I've resited its calling until now because this bottle was caught at its best. There is a touch of weediness (well it's not the best vintage ever), but the balance is fine. This is the sort of wine that makes keeping fine wine so satisfying. I could drink a lot of this, alas though this was my last bottle. A charming ****
A coarser wine than the Pichon above, with higher toned acidity and a more granular structure. Good, pleasant wine that held its own. A good, solid ***
From a half. Marmalade nose, and a waxy, lanolin palate. A bit simple possibly, but showing rather nicely. ***

I can't usually get too excited about Sancerre, but this is rather enjoyable. It has enough age to have lost its initial zing, but still has a pleasing balance of fruit, acid and honeyed, grassy flavours. ***
This is Syrah, Garnacha and Tempranillo in the ratio 7:2:1. Modern wine, but well made with a dryness of fruit balanced by good tannins. A bit closed at present I feel, but it probably has some potential. A cautious **(*)

RY, DL and JA came to a small midweek dinner.  Notes are from memory - I was feeling too lazy to write anything down.
Elegant, lacks a bit of weight and grip perhaps - mostly the vintage I guess.  Fine wine but lacking any very special buzz. Top ***
Smoky, refined, holding nicely although for drinking in the next year or two.  Rather lovely. Top ****
Reminder to self: I must stop thinking of eighties Clarets as infants. This is pretty much mature although it will probably evolve interestingly over a decade or more.   Very classic cigar-box and cassis.  A pleasure to drink. Top ****
Exotic, or perhaps I just don't drink enough Brunello.  Fresh, herby, redolent in a curious way of ice-cream.   Very attractive. Top ***
Coming towards maturity - great breeding: fine balance in quite a weighty wine.  All the classic Barsac characteristics. ****
Green-rimmed, quite fresh, elegant nose.   Perhaps lacking the weight and complexity of the best Colheitas but a rather good drink. Slips down very easily - the bottle is empty today! Top ***

A bit disappointing - too easy to drink. That may sound odd, but I want my Chablis with some green acidity and this wine is too soft and lacking structure. Having said that, it's not bad. I suppose a grudging ***

Opened with trepidation given Toby's recent article ablout 1996 white Burgundy. This one, however, was fine. Elegant, light to medium bodied and with good use of oak. Good texture to the wine. Possibly needs more time in bottle to be at its absolute best. ****
I don't know whether to score this wine or not. When first opened there was an immediate whiff of corkiness. However, returning to the wine later in the evening no corkiness was present, but it did seem a bit flabby and with an oxidised edge. I am now drinking the rest of the bottle as I type. Again, when I first took the cork out (a different cork to keep it stoppered up over night) a corky edge lurked within the wine. But it disappeared! As had the oxidised edge! The wine I am drinking now is a delight of steely mature chardonnay. Wine left overnight like this usually leaves me cold (see the note for Pichon '92 below). But this wine seems to be living in reverse (if I left it another few days I'd probably end up with a bunch of grapes). Quite a lot of crystals are present in the wine (they actually made a noise on the bottom of the glass when I poured the last glass from the bottle). Scored as it is now drinking: top ***
Beginning to tire - fruit oxidising. Drinkable, but not for too much longer. ***
A joy. Not a wine that needs too much thinking about, but delivers what is expected of a decent twenty-year-old Pauillac. Elegance and grace, and with the clarety minerality of age. At peak, I think, but no rush to drink up. ****
I have quite a lot of this wine, and I have been a bit concerned of more recent times whether I needed to rush to drink it up. On this bottle's showing, I need not have too many worries about that. Not quite up to the standard of the previous wine (it somehow lacks the breeding), but good nonetheless with fruit and maturity working well together. No rush to drink up. ****
A bottle opened the night before which LJM brought round on the off chance. Alas, not really fair to judge this wine in such condition. So I won't score. Not Rated
From a half. Dark tarry, amber colour. Lovely black treacle nose. ***
Theme of Alsace white "Preferably on the VT+ side of richness" and "Spanish reds from anywhere (but obviously from Spain)". Oh, and a fizz to start with.
Inferior Italian fizz. Soft. *

I thought this was riesling! Some sweetnes and richness with a touch of steel. Not as long as it might be. ***

Very thin compared with the other wines of the evening (my fault for bringing it!). Good, but not showing as well as it should. Liquorice and mineral. I liked it, others didn't. ***

Good textured wine, with slightly bitter tannins. Black cherry fruit. ***

Mineral, dry, fairly austere, quite flavoury.  Very nice.  Top ***
Quite forward - eminently approachable already.  Authentic Burgundy fruit, decent acidity and a sophisticated creaminess to the texture - all very good.  It seemed to lack a measure of intensity, particularly late on the palate - it seems to fail to be either properly intellectual or properly hedonistic.   A good wine, for drinking over the next couple of years.  Top ***
Genuine chalky minerality and, once it has opened up, rich (but not excessively so) nectarine-kernel fruit.  Nice acidity and good length.  Starting to drink quite well now but no hurry to consume. Easy **(*)
Clean, mineral, pure and delicious. ***
It's a good trick, combining tautness and minerality with creamy-textured fruit. Delicious  - and nosign of the problems thatplague the vintage.  Bare ***(*)
Rich and full, fairly advanced (as the wines from this producer often are) but no sign of the premature oxidation tha plagues the vintage.  There's a bitter edge to the fruit that stops me giving the highest rating - it's a funny thing, bitterness:  sometimes it seems  an asset to a wine sometimes a problem.  I'm not so  keen on its manifestation in this wine.  Still a top ***

Tropically edged green-pea fruit.  Manages to be quite easily fruity but pretty dry and appetising. Good intensity and length. Very pure and enjoyable.  **
Light-coloured, fragrant, pinot-like. Really fairly simple but pleasant.  Makes **
Intense brambly fruit - quite forward.  Easy-going, more or less drinking now.  ***
Dark and dense - wood still a bit evident on a concentrated background.  As it opens up it is just simply very good. ***(*)
The fruit seems very mature - almost over.  Herby - quite complex. Still quite tannic. As Paolo de Marchi remarked, there can be a problem with Sangiovese of the fruit maturing before the tannins. Bare ****
Quite mineral as Cabernet goes.  Rounded, easy, very drinkable, but without the edge of the Ceparello. ***
A bit higher-toned perhaps.  More tannins but generally a little bit thinner. Still nicely elegant. **(*)
Quite sweet.  Fairly sherried and very intense.  Lovely concentration. ****

One of those wines that is just bordering on the past it, but is still pleasant and intersting to drink: it's possibly just that bit too oxidised, but this has given it a nutty character. **
Rather disjointed and disappointing - a bit volatile. It might come together, but I think not. *
Not something to get too excited about, but with decent, sweet strawberry/cherry fruit. **

Well put together tight wine, bright and vibrant. Good fruit, nice balance. Probably only for short term aging. A good **(*)

White bread leaps about of the bottle on opening.   Nutty, dry, green apples - the fruit changes every time you come back to it.   A prestige cuvee that lives up the billing.  Lovely drinking. Easy ****
Could do with another year or so to mellow, but this is nicely structured fizz with floral aromas and refined, appley pinot fruit (it's a BdN, I believe) with overtones of white chocolate. Pleasingly dry. Top ***
A blend of grapes from 89,90 and 91 - Cuvee 5, disgorged March 04. Fresh bread and apple nose, rich full yeasty and meaty palate. Perhaps in danger of being a bit coarse without food (as Blanc de Noirs sometimes are) - possibly a little more time in bottle will help. Complex and with a long, honied finish.  This opens up with a little breathing and is really rather good.  Top ****
Honey, yeast, apples - a complex nose and palate that repays attention. This still seems a bit tightly wound as yet.  My impression is that while very good there's no extra depth of character apparent from its "single vineyard" status.   A prestige cuvee I'll try again but I won't be rushing. Bare ****
Unpleasantly oxidised. I hope this is an odd bottle. Not Rated
A half, opened rather soon after shipping.  Seemed confected and estery at first, quite citric but with decent concentration.   I think this is better than it initially seems.  Let's say it is scraping ***
White bread and currants on the nose.  Light to medium weight - elegant fruit. Quite a lot of Meunier - which shows slightly negatively on the palate. Very good but could one ask for slightly more intensity without sacrificing the elegance? I'm not sure.  I'm being critical - but this is very nice.  (2001 plus reserve wines - disgorged June 2004 - I like the informative back-label). Very top ***
Rich nose - chocolate, yeast, dense fruit.  Quite a weighty, vinous palate - perhaps a bit heavy at the moment and perhaps rather wood-influenced, but this might mellow with a year or two in bottle into something very fine.   Might even rate another star in its way but for now ***
Touch of white bread but mainly ripe Granny Smith apples on the nose. Pretty decent basic NV. Bare ***
Perfectly pleasant but a bit nondescript.  This has aged OK without really developing in an interesting way. ***
This is rather dominated by farmyard straw on the nose an palate - too rustic for me in a way that I don't think will improve with age.  OK, but no more than that.  Bare ***
100% old-vine Pinot Meunier and thus interesting.   Floral and perhaps floury (or am I being influenced by the name of the grape) fruit, quite forward in the mouth and a bit colourless on the mid-palate with an ordinary finish.   Real Champagne balance (quite dry) makes it pretty drinkable however, although it is hard to find much real complexity.   An oddity that is worth trying, particularly if one wants to get a grip on the grape and what it might contribute to wines like Moet NV, for instance.  Scrapes ***
Quite autolytic, appley fruit, complex an honied, quite dry and with good pinot gutsiness.  All this after seeming a bit maderised at first, but as often with Champagne this seemed to blow off. Excellent. ****
Citric, appley nose with yeasty notes - quite complex.  Ripe, rounded fruit despite the excellent acidity of the vintage - needs a bit more time though - aspects of it seem quite tightly wound still.   Quite long too and creamy textured.   ****(*)
Light to medium weight, elegant, complex and nutty, quite long.   Just occasionally it seems a little oily/keroseney on the palate but that may be the food I am having with it.   Really pretty good, although probably for drinking over the next couple of years.  A good deal from Oddbins at not muchover �20. Bare ****
A bit coarse on first sip, but this seems less noticable afterwards.  The fruit quality is a way short of Champagne so a fairly basic wine. Pleasnat enough. *

Mainly from my own cellar, tasted in the last month or two
Quite mineral, but this seems a bit flabbier, flatter and lacking freshness than I remember.   I could worry that we have a touch of premature-oxidation disease here although the wine is perfectly drinkable.   I hope it's an odd bottle, the one I had in July 2004 was fine and I've had a couple since which I did not note because they were similar.   **
Nice fruit, very drinkable.  Quite luscious even with a richness that one might attribute to the standing of the vineyard.  Good balance too.   But nice though it is, I find it rather undemanding - no tautness, no succulence, in short no really grown-up qualities.   I'd hope for more excitment from this vineyard.  Still a fine drink, and it doesn't sell for huge money either.  ***
A bottle drunk over two evenings as opposed to my last notr from the middle of a wine dinner.   Bright and attractive raspberry, cranberry and beetroot Pinot - a touch of oak and tannins but fundamentally in an easy drinking style.   Very pleasant drinking but not profound.   Will improve a touch over a shortish timescale but not a long-term wine. ***
Very (excessively even) citric, good acidity and a modest finish.  No sign of 96 oxidation.  I was given this knowing only that it was a 96 white Burgundy - thought it might be a disappointing grander wine.  Actually this is rather good for its level. Top **
On first opening, bright, high-toned, delciously fruity - mainly red fruits - and with good balance and length.  Very quaffable.  Later, some minerality appears too and it seems stylish too.  Very nice indeed.  Probably for drinking over the next few years.   A very top ***
Even with decanting, still quite hard and needing food.   Stylish - I hope it will resolve well. ***
A bit reductive at first, opens out to reveal strong high-toned fruit and a bit of pinot animality.  A touch hard at the moment, particularly without food, but pretty good.  Top ***
Splendidly mineral and delicious. Bare ****
One bottle rather orange an unpalatable - oxidized Burgundy syndrome, I fear.   Another quite mature and hinting at the same but still rather good and pleasantly drinkable. The good one: **
Fresh strawberry fruit, moderate acidity, some tannins and still quite firm although the acidity is moderate.   Opens out nicely overnight but still has a twist of bitterness at the end of the palate that I have mixed feelings about.  Bare ***
Bone-dry, austere at first but then just very classic appetising white Burgundy at peak. Bare ****

Ravishingly gorgeous, elegant, fragrant fruit.  Very lovely, if a little light and perhaps no more than it ought to be for a Grand Cru.  Some want to keep this for 10 years and (probably) good it will be in rather a different way, but I love it now too. *****

Friends brought this round for lunch. Lovely medium weight Burgundy with touches of toffee, nuts and melon. Good to have a wine that doesn't seem sterile in its freshness and isn't trying to be any more than it should be. ***
And here's the coincidence. I just happened to drag this out of the racks in preparation for the same lunch. This, as one would expect, has more signs of age - there's also a slight dirtiness/stalkiness to the wine (again none of that sterility that can make some modern wine so boring). Good maturing Burgundy. ***
This wine has been a bit of an enigma over the years - Toby and I have both given varying reports. This bottle, however, was exactly what it should be. Fresh and vibrant, sweet strawberry and beetroot, and with good acidity. More than pleasant. ****

Intriguing brown-sugar nose with lots of mineral terroir notes.   Very classic and savoury - gorgeous.  Returning to it:  walnut nose and the palate too is like licking one.  High-toned again.   Really splendid but still needs time. *****(*)
Classic, quite austrere and high toned - very 66.   Good length too, but it seems just very slightly corked.  Clearly excellent, but I'll not rate it.  Not Rated
Stunning mix of flavours - quite fascinating.  Hints at an edgy volatility too.  Delicious but needs drinking - it may be a bit unstable. Top ****
Perfectly balanced mature Claret - So mineral.  An absolute pleasure from beginning to end. *****
Stands out above the last two wines with an amazing extra depth and huge complexity.  Suave, yet dry.  Very, very long.  No hurry to drink. ******
Very ripe and rounded - silky rich texture and a long, complex palate.  Relatively forward.   I can see how this got its rave reviews from Parker, but on returning there are piquant notes too.   Top ****
Corked.  Not Rated
Hopelessly oxidised - surely an odd bottle.  Not Rated
Much more classic than the 90 - dry, flavoury with marked tannins.   My impression is that while very good this won't become a star like the 70 or 61 - it seems a touch lighter.   ***(*)
Exotic coconut nose, creamy.   Not Claret as we know it, but fascinating.   There's great depth and structure and so this probably will be stunning in a while.  Bare ****(*)
Young wine cassis - but Montrose minerality too.  Fairly ripe - it seems in a slightly softer more modern style than the later wines in this flight. Good though.   ***
Liquid minerals and excellent fruit.  Very good and will be lovely.  ***(*)
Very dense - a cross between 98 and 90.   Qute a monster, but perhaps some of the older wines were that way in their youth. Still, this will surely be lovely in ten years. ***(**)
Mineral again but a bit more restrained and classic - less exotic than the 96.   I like it a lot - almost more than the 96 - very stylish and balanced.  ***(**)
A blend of 91, 90 and 89.  Apple and mushroom nose and palate - very meaty and substantial.  Big finish. ****
Two bottles, quite different.  One very honied and becoming a bit austere.  One fresher with nice richness.   Both quite good. ***
Pleasant old thing - it may be the end of a long night, but it seems just to be fading a touch.  ***

Nutty, honied, touch of herbs, quite elusive - occasionally has a certain flatness. Rather attractive.  ***
Very reductive but after a while in the glass, fragrant, sous-bois, nutty. Real tar and roses. Reveals more each time ypon come back to it.  Bare *****
Very pleasantly fruity although a touch of oxidation too.  Some bottle variation.  Drink up.  Good ***
Fresh, mainstream old Barolo - tar and roses again. Very nice. ****

Before the event, while waiting for a taxi at D.L.'s.  Deep colour,  marmalade, brown sugar, very attractive. Dry enough at this time in its life to be a plausible aperitif. Top ***
Not so deep a colour,  but very bright.  Slightly leesy nose with very floral, high-toned fruit.  In the mouth, nice tannins, lovely acidity and great length. Very classy.  Bare ***(**)

Lovely - hints at old Sherry and Madeira.  Fantastically elegant and fine from appearance to finish. Stunning. *****

Floral, suggestions of warm hay.  Light, refreshing, noticably off-dry. **
A single vineyard wine. Floral, richer and better delineated than the basic wine. Very drinkable. ***
A special selection from various vineyards. Dumb on the nose with some yeasty notes. Very much demi-sec but nicely balanced with a rich palate. ***
Cartizze is meant to be the very best area. Demi-sec again with a refined, complex nose and the sweetness seems in balance.  Quite long.   Top ***
Still Prosecco - it does seem rather featureless! *
A passito wine made from Prosecco grapes and bottled from a Solera established in 1991 (this example bottled in 2003).  Banana nose, elegant, attractive palate. Very nice. At least ***
The usual zoo - bottles everywhere, great fun.   The notes are consequently quite brief and impressionistic.
Nice nose but rather off-dry on the palate - spoils a nice wine.  Bare ***

High-toned, bright, delicious.  ****
Grenache - ripe - luscious (nice vintage, I suppose).  Some complaints that it was light and Burgundian - but I thought it just proper Grenachey Chateauneuf.   Pleasant but fading just a bit.  ***
Very fine indeed.  *****
Pure, structured, intense but unforced.  Has the makings of a classic La Chapelle.   ***(*)
Pure and elegant but very gutless and lacking complexity. Disappointing.   A sign that Jaboulet is losing it? **
Kerosene, intense, OK but not huge acidity. Very nice. ****
Not the best bottle - woody  taint. Still fine. I'd give this three stars but I know it's an even better wine. Not Rated
Ice-cream - lovely, dry, piquant  palate - intense.  Quite tannic.  Perhaps ****
Luxury pudding wine - fresh (disgorged 2003 I believe).   Complex and lovely though I wonder if it would be better Brut.  A taste of how Champagne was a century ago. Top ***
Pleasant old thing - without being particularly striking.  ***

Like all the Gravner whites, a deep golden colour quite unlike most modern white wines. Jammy nectarine nose, rather red-wine-like.   Grapey peach palate, long and honied.  Striking and interesting. It has the structure (some tannins) and balance to improve. Lovely. ****(*)
A little diffuse on the nose by comparison - there's some extra complexity from the odd mix of grapes involved, but I feel that is superficial and I prefer the honied purity of the Ribolla. Excellent again.  ****
Honied nectarine again, excellent but lacking the depth of the 1999 - also perhaps a touch "flatter". Still exciting. Bare ****
Interesting, fine flavours - again a lot less weighty than the 1999.  Perhaps scrapes in at ****

High-toned cherry fruit right through the palate.  Charming, nice tannins, decent acidity.  Very good. **(*)
Ripe, very pure, cherry-like again.   Pretty exciting wine, needing a few years yet. Top **(*)
Fresh, complex, lovely balance, this does not seem heavily extracted with its graceful elegance.  Very fine.  Top ***
I don't seem to have tasted so much this year and the notes are hurried.  Too much good conversation!
Vinous nose, floral and rich fruit.  I Good length, but it does seem very wood-influenced. No dosage, I believe, but it seems well-balanced. ***
A "solera wine" I gather. Yeasty, rather good.   I must try a bottle properly one day. Top ***
Tangy, salty, lovely old wine. Top ***
Very fine and elegant with good intensity and length.  Unless it fills out, it seems a little light on the mid-palate.  Perhaps I am under-rating this - for now a top ***

Very closed.  Becomes honeyed and delicious - needs decanting. Provence herbs - bags of character.   ***(*)

Fine, attractive nose but the fruit while initially exciting is marred by a bitter twist towards the finish.   This defect seems less evident a day later - while the wine seems quite mature, I wonder if it might benefit from more time.  Pretty good. ***
Cashews, yeasty bread, honey, creamy fruit - a different character on returning each time.   Taught acidity and good length.  Really fine - perhaps even ****(*)
Brioche and honey nose, quite citric (lemon and grapefruit) palate.  A little disjointed still but time will draw it together nicely.   Softly frothy now, as one might expect from its youth.  Very good. ***(*)
Most of my recent notes of this wine have been from a single case bought at auction a while ago.  I have since discovered from the nice people at Gosset that it is a 93+94+95 blend.  Lovely honey and apples with yeasty undertones.  Some will say it is showing a touch of oxidative character and I suppose it is although I don't find it remotely a problem.  Very rich but now in perfect balance. ****
Quitelarge-framed, a bit coarse and difficult towards the finish - perhaps a year in bottle would help.  Ok, but I'm not wild about this. From a half. Bare ***
Doughy but floral nose, quite tight, dry and precise,  elegant palate  - decent length but with a touch of hardness that needs a year or two.  Very good.   Bare ***(*)

Nicely shaped bottle, and reasobale stuff inside it. A bit coarse and woody, and a bit too sweet. **(*)
I think I've had this for a few years. It's certainly worth keeping. Lovely honeyed and mineral palate. A joy. Just goes to show that you shouldn't rush drinking Champagne! Top ***
OK, but nothing out of the ordinary. **
I haven't had Koonunga Hill for ages. I was pleasantly surprised. Very Penfolds in style (no bad thing to my mind) - velvety smooth, not trying to be too big, gentle on the head. ***
Good nose, but not typical. A really very coarse palate. *

Rather fine fruit with just a touch of lychee -  not very varietal now, more mineral - some will say too old but I think its at a peak.  Pleasingly dry too - quite a fine wine.   Is this just age or is this old-style Zind before the days of extra residual sugar?  Whatever, it's rather nice.  Top ***
Tarry, fragrant, everything you could want from a typical, good Barolo in a decent but not special vintage.   Needs drinking in the next few years.  Top ***
Rather deliciously smooth and fragrantly, softly Volnay.   I noted after a while that this had been tarted up with quite a lot of new oak.  Very good of its kind, and quite good even in absolute terms. ***
Lovely old-wine nose, fresh fruit.  Coarsened after 30 minutes or so and faded a bit.  Still rather pleasant.  No indication on this half as to whether this was a Riserva or anything.   Bare ***

Promoted conversation - apart from anything else putting a wax seal on an Australian wine is making a statement.   A touch mineral,  quite complex fruit - pure too and not overstated.

Lightweight yet concentrated.  Ethereal, complex chocolatey fruit.  Lovely.  *****
These three wines were very kindly sent by the winery who had noticed that FWD isn't always very kind to Beaujolais. I tasted these with LJM (sometime contributor to FWD). I'm afraid that these three wines still failed to convince me completely about Beaujolais. But they have persuaded me that I need to try a few more.
Earthy, fresh fruity zingy nose with a hint of vanilla - good texture on the palate. My favourite of the three wines for drinking now. ***
I'm afraid I couldn't really get on with this wine - it seemed light and dilute and was a touch green at the end. Possibly a faulty bottle so I won't score Not Rated
Quite a soft wine - maturity taking over from the earlier gamay vibrancy I guess. Initially a bit dumb and subdued, but after time the wine opened out. It would be interesting to try this in another couple of years to see whether it is just at a bit of an inbetween phase. For now ***

Excellent condition at 10 years old, very good fruit too, although for some reason I could not get that excited about it.  Still a decent ***
My last bottle of this - and hasn't it kept well.   Completely fresh but fully mature, quite soft and very pleasingly drinkable. ***

On opening, quite tough - you have to like tannins for this.  It does have the most fantastic ripe fruit though and 24 hours after opening it had really opened out.  Delicious.  Easy ***
This guy is one hell of a winemaker.

This is half Chardonnay and half Pinot Meunier - the latter not that apparent. Very yeasty, seems a bit four-square at the moment (perhaps that is where one sees the P-M).

Possibly a touch too old now, but lovely old Champagne nonetheless. Mature and elegant for its depth. ****
One of the first wines I bought with a view to keeping. I love old white Burgundy, and this didn't let me down. Lovely, oily, nutty ethereal stuff. ****
Disappointing. Not past it, but just not particularly special. Maybe it still needs loads more time to develop? **
Lovely pure beetroot and raspberry nose. Drinking very well. Silky. *****
OK, so we drank this thinking it was showing well for the 1978 vintage. The label wasn't in the best condition. The next morning I was just sorting through the corks when I noticed we had really been drinking the 1982. The last time I had this wine I was disappointed, and I was again this time. It's OK, but it hasn't got the structure or depth expected. ***

My memory of vintages of this Provence wine from some years ago is of the fruit being a bit sweet - this though seems rather good: Provencal herbs over cassis fruit with a lot of smoky cigar box.   Very much a point and it has kept well.  A little simple perhaps but I believe this was not a particularly good vintage for the property.   Good effort - I'd like to try some other vintages. ***
Quite concentrated and flavoursome, but lacking finesse for me in a way that I'm not sure more time will alleviate.  PLeasant then but not  fantastic. ***
Smoke and pepper - fruit gently weakening perhaps but very drinkable. ***
Blackberry and apple fruit with interesting sauvage overtones - once open for a few hours, very stylish indeed.   Will probably improve for a year or two.  ***
A bit stinky on opening - it blows off to some extent but a touch of something foetid remains.  Still, quite a dense, brown-sugar palate follows with a hint of volatility or something.   Good rather than exceptional. ***
Fruity, grassy - like a new world semillon.  Pleasant enough. *
Nice fruit quality - quite suave.  Decent length.  Top *
Very fresh raspberry fruit with a meaty underlay.  Very refined texture and good length.   Once it has been open a while it seems even more Burgundian.  It needs a bit more minerality or something to be truly outstanding.  Scrapes ****
Slate, sherbert, a touch sour as MSR wines can be.  Good length, maybe a touch hollow in the middle - something I find occasionally with the vintage.  Fine, but not exceptional by the high standards of the domain.  Top ***
Quite tight and closed, but opens out with time as it warms up.  Excellent intensity and a long brioche finish.  Good balance.  ****(*)
Very thin and dull.  Drinkable but No Stars

Modern-styled, but very nicely done.   Limey acidity.  Satisfying, but completely upstaged by the Jobard that follows.  ***

Sold to me in Oddbins as the wine that beat Dom Perignon in a recent competition. Actually it might have been the NV Blin that did this - different assistants in Oddbins attributed the result to both wines. This wine is good, but not DP good. There's a touch of sweetness and some heaviness of hand. **(*)
Good strawberry nose and pleasantly elegant palate. ***
Drinkable. *

Rich, quite forward (sepcially for the vintage), the quality shows in the persistence.  Lovely Juniper/Gin edge to the nose. ****
A belnd of 95 and 96. Strawberry fruit, impressive at first but it does seem simple compared to the Deutz.   Weighty but not so intense.  Good though for the price.  ***
Quite varietal but with an added complexity and some non-fruit chatracter that makes it stand out.  Drinking very nicely. Top ***
Lighter and a touch vegetal.  A touch thin but nevertheless it is a wine of character. Top **
Richer again, as with the 93 you might struggle to spot the grape variety: no bad thing in my mind.  An interesting mature wine ***

Really quite Northern Rhone-like and very stylish, gamy Syrah. ****
Very complex, smoky wine.  Really lovely. Scrapes *****
Gamy but elegant.  A little overawed by the Rayas wines, but fine. Bare ****
Balanced and rich, but perhaps not showing ideally now.  A little more time might help. Still ****
Very creamy but not rich.   Dies a bit in the glass.   Interesting, and pretty good for an average vintage, vineyard, etc. Top **
Difficult on opening - gamy almost and austere.  Opens out nicely. Top ***
Nicely set up and needing a bit of time yet.   I feel this hasn't the fineness to be great but it is very good.  ***(*)

PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST, by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio
[view looking straight down at rolling swells, sound of wind and thunder, then a low heartbeat]
Scene: PORT ROYAL
[teacups on a table in the rain]
[sheet music on music stands in the rain]
[bouquet of white orchids, Elizabeth sitting in the rain holding the bouquet]
[men rowing, men on horseback, to the sound of thunder]
[EITC logo on flag blowing in the wind]
[many rowboats are entering the harbor]
[Elizabeth sitting alone, at a distance]
[marines running, kick a door in]
[a mule is seen on the left in the barn where the marines enter]
[Liz looking over her shoulder]
[Elizabeth drops her bouquet]
[Will is in manacles, being escorted by red coats]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will...!
[Elizabeth runs to Will]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Why is this happening?
WILL TURNER: I don't know. You look beautiful.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
[marines cross their long axes to bar Governor from entering]
[Beckett, in white hair and curls, is standing with Mercer]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: His Lord now... actually.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake. Arrest her.
ELIZABETH SWANN: On what charges?
WILL TURNER: No!
[Beckett takes another document from Mercer, who is standing with Beckett, craggy face and pony tail]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Ah-ha! Here's the one for William Turner. And I have another one for a Mister James Norrington. Is he present?
ELIZABETH SWANN: *What are the charges?*
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I don't believe that's the answer to the question I asked.
WILL TURNER: Lord Beckett! In the category of questions *not* answered...
ELIZABETH SWANN: We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: For which the punishment, regrettably, is *also* death. Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.
ELIZABETH SWANN: *Captain* Jack Sparrow.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought you might.
Scene: BLACK PEARL
[views of rigging ropes and blocks aboard a ship at night]
[Gibbs walks the deck alone at night, singing and drinking from a bottle]
GIBBS: Fifteen men on a dead man's chest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Drink and the devil had done for the rest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
[a bell tolls, Gibbs is interrupted from his drinking by the sound]
[Gibbs looks up to see a flock of crows flying in the foggy night sky]
Scene: TURKISH PRISON
[tolling of bells, camera pans to show the crows flying toward a coastal island]
[pinnacle-like island off the coast at night, connected to the mainland by thin, lighted bridge]
[cages with men inside line the bridge]
[prisoners are being marched across the bridge]
[a male prisoner with bloody legs is muttering, and is dragged across the bridge by guards]
[a crow is seen reflected in the eye of one male prisoner in a cage, the crow attacks and pecks his eye out, he screams]
[the prisoner who was being dragged is taken down a hatch-like door in the ground, he also screams]
[rocky shoreline, lit with torches]
[men toss caskets into the sea]
[numerous caskets are floating out to sea, vertical streaks in the distant clouds are seen]
[a crow lands on one casket, begins pecking at the top]
[sudden gunblast from inside the casket blows the crow away, along with much wood]
[hand holding flintlock pistol emerges, pans about, points it at audience for a moment]
[Jack breaks out of the top of the casket, puts his captain's hat on]
JACK SPARROW: Sorry, mate.
[Jack breaks the skeleton's leg off]
JACK SPARROW: Mind if we make a little side trip? I didn't think so.
[Jack uses the skeleton leg as an oar, rows toward the full moon and a waiting ship in the distance to the right of the moon]
Scene: BLACK PEARL
[Jack arrives at the Black Pearl in his coffin rowboat]
[Gibbs holds out his hand to help Jack aboard, Jack puts the skeleton leg in Gibbs' hand]
[Cotton drapes a coat onto Jack's back]
GIBBS: Not *quite* according to plan.
JACK SPARROW: Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.
GIBBS: You got what you went in for, then?
JACK SPARROW: Mm-hmm!
GIBBS: Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure with it.
LEECH: And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic.
MARTY: And the hurricane! Aye.
CREW: Aye. Aye.
GIBBS: All in all, it's seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.
JACK SPARROW: Shiny?
GIBBS: Aye, shiny.
JACK SPARROW: Is that how you're all feeling, then? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk! Walk the plank!
[Jack grabs his pistol and points it at the bird]
JACK SPARROW: What did the bird say?
LEECH: Do not blame the bird. Show us what is on that piece of cloth there.
[the monkey snarls, seizes the cloth, scampers off with it]
JACK SPARROW: Ohhh!
[Jack attempts to shoot the monkey with his pistol, his pistol misfires]
[Jack grabs a pistol from another crewman and blasts the monkey while it's on the deck]
[the monkey drops the cloth, but is unharmed, and scurries into the rigging]
GIBBS: Know that don't do no good.
JACK SPARROW: It does me.
[Marty picks up the cloth that the monkey dropped]
MARTY: It's a key!
JACK SPARROW: No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key.
[Jack holds up the cloth, the crew crowd forward]
[Among the crew: Chinese man, black man with a black beard, white bearded man with large black hat]
JACK SPARROW: Gentlemen, what do keys do?
LEECH: Keys... unlock... *things*?
GIBBS: And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there's something valuable. So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!
JACK SPARROW: No! If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
GIBBS: So - We're going after this key!
JACK SPARROW: You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions?
MARTY: So... Do we have a heading?
JACK SPARROW: Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... a general... in *that* way - direction.
GIBBS: Cap'n?
JACK SPARROW: Come on, snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Come on, oy/quick, oy/quick, hey!
[Marty and Gibbs gather alone by the railing]
MARTY: Have you noticed lately... The captain seems to be actin' a bit strange... -er.
GIBBS: Settin' sail without knowing his own headin'? Somethin's got Jack vexed. Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.
[the Black Pearl is shown at night in a thunderstorm]
Scene: PORT ROYAL: EITC HEADQUARTERS
[a painter is painting a detail on a mural of a world map]
[a guard brings Will in manacles into Beckett's office]
GUARD: Lord Beckett. The prisoner as ordered, Sir.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Those won't be necessary.
[Will's manacles are removed]
[Beckett pours some liquor]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: The East India Trading Company has need of your services. We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow.
WILL TURNER: More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: We've had dealings in the past. And we've each left our mark... on the other.
WILL TURNER: What mark did he leave on you?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set free. I would like you to go to him, and recover a certain property in his possession.
WILL TURNER: Recover. At the point of a sword?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: *Bargain*!
[Beckett goes over to a wooden box on a table and opens it]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Letters of Marque. You will offer what amounts to a full pardon. Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.
WILL TURNER: Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Freedom. Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. The world is shrinking, the blank pages of the map filled in. Jack must find his place in the new world or perish. Not unlike you, Mister Turner. You and your fianc�e face the hangman's noose.
WILL TURNER: So you get both Jack *and* the Black Pearl.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: The Black Pearl?
WILL TURNER: The property you want that he possesses.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: A ship? Hardly. The item in question's considerably smaller and far more valuable. Something Sparrow keeps on his person at all times. A compass. Ah, you know it. Bring back that Compass, or there's no deal.

[Jack walks over to see who spoke]
JACK SPARROW: Bootstrap. Bill Turner.

JACK SPARROW: Is this a dream?
JACK SPARROW: I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.
[Bootstrap immediately hands Jack a bottle of rum]
[Jack pries the bottle from Bootstrap's hand with a crackling sound]
JACK SPARROW: I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way.
[Jack tinks the lip of the bottle with his fingers, then blows across the top of the bottle]
JACK SPARROW: Your son.
[Jack takes a drink from the bottle]
JACK SPARROW: And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?
JACK SPARROW: Who?
JACK SPARROW: Ah. So it's you, then. He shanghaied you into service, eh?
[a small hermit crab scuttles by Bootstrap, on top of the barrel where Bootstrap sits]
[Bootstrap grabs the hermit crab, pops it into his mouth, and crunches on it]
[Jack moves his mouth, jaw, and tongue around in revulsion while watching]
[Jack hands the bottle back to Bootstrap]
JACK SPARROW: It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment -
[Jack starts to walk off, but Bootstrap stands up at the same time and intercepts Jack, blocking him]
JACK SPARROW: Technic -
JACK SPARROW: Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already *has* a captain, so there's re -
JACK SPARROW: Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
[Jack looks at the palm of his left hand, where a black spot boils into view]

JACK SPARROW: Ah! Ooh! Run! Land.

WILL TURNER: Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal. In exchange the charges against us will be dropped.
WILL TURNER: Is that lack of faith in Jack, or in me?
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have faith in you. Both of you. Where will you find him?
WILL TURNER: Tortuga. I'll start there, and I won't stop searching 'til I find him. And then I intend to return here, to marry you.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Properly?
WILL TURNER: Eagerly, if you'll still have me.
ELIZABETH SWANN: If it weren't for these bars I'd have you already.

ELIZABETH SWANN: Then what is?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency of the realm.

LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I'm listening.
[Elizabeth pulls a pistol, points it at Beckett's head]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I'm listening *intently*.
ELIZABETH SWANN: These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Do explain.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Ah, I see. *You* think the Compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you hope to *save* me from an evil fate. But you mustn't worry. I care not for cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not so provincial. There's more than one chest of value in these waters. So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer.
[Elizabeth cocks her pistol]
[Beckett signs the document]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: So I did. A marriage interrupted. Or fate intervenes. You make great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.
ELIZABETH SWANN: These aren't going to Jack.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's freedom, then? I'll still want that Compass. Consider that in your calculations. Longboat
[Ragetti appears to be reading a Bible in the back of the longboat, but the Bible is upside-down]

[the dog goes to the bow, looking forward, keys in its mouth]
RAGETTI: ?: Well how'dya know it weren't/wasn't divine providence what inspired you to *be* clever? Anyways, I ain't stealin' no ship.
PINTEL: It ain't stealin'. It's *salvagin'*! And since when did you care?
RAGETTI: Since we're not immortal no more. We gotta take care of our immortal souls.
PINTEL: You know you can't read.
RAGETTI: It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.
PINTEL: Pretendin' to read the Bible's a *lie*! *That's* a mark against ya! Look! There it is!
[the dog jumps overboard and swims toward shore]
RAGETTI: What's got into *'im*?

WILL TURNER: Why would he do this to us? If Jack is their chief.
GIBBS: Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief. But he only remains chief as long as he *acts* like a chief.
WILL TURNER: So he had no choice. He's a captive then as much as the rest of us.
GIBBS: Worse... as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a *god* in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison.
[Cotton bites Gibbs' fingers to illustrate]
GIBBS: Argh! They'll roast him and eat him.
WILL TURNER: Where's the rest of the crew?
GIBBS: These cages we're in... weren't built 'til *after* we got here.
[Will was gripping the bars made of human bones, but quickly pulls his hand away]

LEECH: Actually, you won't need everyone. 'Bout six would do! Ohhh... dear.

WILL TURNER: This... is going to save Elizabeth?
JACK SPARROW: How much do you know about Davy Jones?
WILL TURNER: Not much.

BURSAR: It's not like that, Sir. This ship is haunted.
BELLAMY: Is it now? 'N' you?
QUARTERMASTER: The... female presence... amongst us, yes... all the men... they can feel it. The ghost of a lady, widowed before her marriage, I figure it. Searching for her husband, lost at sea. A virgin, too, likely as not. And that bodes ill by all accounts.
BURSAR: I say... that we throw the dress overboard, and we hope the spirit finds it.
QUARTERMASTER: No! That - that will just anger the spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back!
BELLAMY: Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you. Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh... she's probably naked.
[the crew enthusiastically rushes off in search of the stowaway] Pantano River
[aerial view of the mouth of the Pantano River, two longboats are beginning their way up the river]
[the longboats are in a swampy area with twisted roots]
WILL TURNER: Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
GIBBS: Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off. And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness. The Kraken!
[Marty turns around at mention of the word, Pintel and Ragetti look at each other]
GIBBS: They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh! Imagine: The last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken, and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. If you believe such things.
WILL TURNER: And the key will spare him that?
GIBBS: Now that's the very question Jack wants answered. Bad enough even to go visit... *Her*.
WILL TURNER: Her?
GIBBS: Aye.
BAYOU: Tia's shack
[bayou with fireflies, and an iguana on a tree trunk on the left]
[the iguana eats a firefly with a quick slurping sound]
[people are occasionally seen standing quietly in the darkness among the trees]
JACK SPARROW: No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable we are. Were. Have been. Before.
GIBBS: I'll watch your back.
JACK SPARROW: It's me front I'm worried about. Mind the boat.
GIBBS: Mind the boat.
WILL TURNER: Mind the boat.
PINTEL: Mind the boat.
MARTY: Mind the boat.
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk! Mind the boat!
[Cotton is left alone in the longboat]
[Jack cautiously enter's Tia's shack, pushing the door open slowly]
[near the inside of the shack door hangs a live snake, moving slowly]
[Tia is sitting at a table, looks up from her crab claws, sees Jack in the doorway]
TIA DALMA: Jack Sparrow!
JACK SPARROW: Tia Dalma!
TIA DALMA: I always know de wind was goin' blow you back to me one day.
[Tia sees Will standing in the doorway, goes up to him]
TIA DALMA: You. You have a touch of... destiny about *you*, William Turner.
WILL TURNER: You know me?
TIA DALMA: You want to know *me*.
JACK SPARROW: There'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.
JACK SPARROW: I thought *I* knew you.
TIA DALMA: Not so well as I had hoped. Come.
JACK SPARROW: Come.
TIA DALMA: What... service... may I do you? Hmmm? You know I demand payment.
JACK SPARROW: I brought payment.
[Jack whistles once, a crewmember brings in the monkey in a cage]
JACK SPARROW: Look!
[Jack cocks his pistol, shoots the monkey, the bullet has no effect, but the monkey chatters in fright]
JACK SPARROW: An undead monkey! Top that!
[Tia lifts the cage door, the monkey scampers off]
GIBBS: No! You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.
TIA DALMA: The payment is fair.
JACK SPARROW: We're looking for this. And what it goes to.
TIA DALMA: The Compass you bartered from me. It cannot lead you to dis?
JACK SPARROW: Maybe. Why?
TIA DALMA: Ayeee... Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants! Or... do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own. Your key go to a chest, and it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it?
GIBBS: What *is* inside?
PINTEL: Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature?
RAGETTI: Nothing... bad, I hope.
[a jar of eyeballs is hanging next to Ragetti's face as he speaks]
TIA DALMA: You know of... Davy Jones, yes? A man of de sea. A great sailor, until he ran afoul of dat which vex all men.
WILL TURNER: What vexes all men?
TIA DALMA: What, indeed.
GIBBS: The sea?
PINTEL: Sums!
RAGETTI: Dichotomy of good and evil.
JACK SPARROW: A *woman*.
TIA DALMA: A wo-*man*. He fell in love.
GIBBS: No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea* he fell in love with.
TIA DALMA: Same story, different versions, and all are true. See, it was a *woman*, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid. But not enough to cause him to die.
WILL TURNER: What... exactly did he put into the chest?
TIA DALMA: Him heart.
RAGETTI: Literally, or figuratively?
PINTEL: He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest! Could he?
TIA DALMA: It was not wort' feeling what... small fleeting joy life brings, and so... he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at all times.
WILL TURNER: You knew this.
JACK SPARROW: I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do. So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey!
TIA DALMA: Let me see your hand.
[Jack shows his right hand is untouched, but Tia unwraps the bandage on his left hand]
[the black spot on Jack's left hand is revealed]
GIBBS: Uhhh! The black spot!
[Gibbs quickly wipes his hands on his chest, spins around once to the left, and spits] Black spot! Black spot!
[Pintel and Ragetti copy Gibbs' ritual, in synchrony]
JACK SPARROW: My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.
[pushing aside cloth door beads, Tia goes into a back room, and searches for something]
TIA DALMA: I am justMy little ###, where are you? ###
[Jack steals a ring off of one of Tia's tables, beside the ring is a silver locket]
[Tia comes back with an object from the back room]
TIA DALMA: Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years. Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow. And so you will carry land wid you...
[Tia hands Jack a jar of dirt]
JACK SPARROW: Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.
TIA DALMA: Yes?
JACK SPARROW: Is the... jar of dirt going to help?
TIA DALMA: If you don' want it, give it back.
JACK SPARROW: No.
TIA DALMA: Den it helps.
WILL TURNER: It seems... we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.
[Tia is sitting, she holds several crab shells between her cupped hands and closes her eyes]
TIA DALMA: A touch... of destiny!
[Tia throws the crab claws down on the table to see how they fall]
[fade to aerial view of rocky islands whose positions match the positions of the crab claws] Black Pearl
[pan beyond the rocks to the Black Pearl just offshore, in stormy weather]
[the Black Pearl crew look at the scuttled ship on the rocks]
WILL TURNER: That's the Flying Dutchman? She doesn't look like much.
JACK SPARROW: Neither do you. Do *not* underestimate her.
[Jack gives Gibbs a meaningful glance, elbows Gibbs]
GIBBS: Must've run afoul of the reef.
JACK SPARROW: So what's your plan, then?
WILL TURNER: I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.
JACK SPARROW: And if there are crewmen?
WILL TURNER: I cut down anyone in my path.
JACK SPARROW: I like it. Simple, easy to remember.
RAGETTI: Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha, ha-ha-ha, ha-ha!
JACK SPARROW: Hey! If you *do* happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt! Might save your life!
RAGETTI: Bon voyage! Ha-ha-ha!
JACK SPARROW: Douse the lamps.
[Marty douses a lamp, then Cotton douses a lamp, then Pintel douses a lamp]
[Will sets off in a rowboat, alone, toward the scuttled ship]
SCUTTLED SHIP: before attack
[Will goes aboard the ship, lantern in hand]
[Will passes one dead crewman at deck level, proped up behind net-like rigging]
[Will comes across a wounded sailor, who seems to be in shock]
[the wounded sailor is pulling on a pulley desperately, muttering to himself]
WOUNDED SAILOR: ...up the...
WILL TURNER: Sailor!
WOUNDED SAILOR: ...the stench...capsized...
WILL TURNER: Sailor!
WOUNDED SAILOR: ...bring a...
WILL TURNER: There's no use. You've run aground.
WOUNDED SAILOR: No! Beneath us! Foul breath!
[behind Will, a crewmember's body falls from a height, splashing into the water]
[Will goes to investigate]
WILL TURNER: Hey! Hey!
[Will turns the man's body over to see his face]
[the man's face is gone, his face is just a puckered piece of skin, which bulges outward]
[the real Flying Dutchman suddenly rises from the sea, nearby the scuttled ship]
[the sea creature-like crew emerge from the surfaces of the Flying Dutchman]
[crewmembers from the Flying Dutchman attack the remaining crew of the scuttled ship]
GREENBEARD: Down on your marrowbones, and pray.
[Will engages in a swordfight against several invaders]
[Will dips his sword in oil, causing it to flame, and waves it at the men surrounding him]
WILL TURNER: Get back! Back!
[Will slices open the stomach of one of the invaders, fish spill out of it onto the deck]
[Will battles the invading crewmembers, but one of them knocks Will unconscious] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
SCUTTLED SHIP: after attack
[the prisoners of the scuttled ship cower in fear, lined up, sitting in a row on deck along the railing]
[Jack is at the end of the row of five survivors total, on the right-side when facing the survivors]
[Davy Jones stomps aboard with his peg leg, underwater view of his departing feet]
[Maccus is on deck, turned so that his back is shown, showing lobster legs on his back]
MACCUS: Five men still alive. The rest have moved on.
[Jones pauses to clench his left hand, which is a large lobster claw]
[Jones casually lights a pipe in front of one of the cowering crewmen]
DAVY JONES: Do you fear death? Do you fear that dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished. I can offer you... an escape-uh.
CHAPLAIN: Don't listen to him!
[Jones walks over to the chaplain, takes the chaplain's head in his claw]
DAVY JONES: Do you not fear death?
CHAPLAIN: I'll take my chances, Sir.
DAVY JONES: To the depths.
[the chaplain's throat is slit, two crewmembers throw his body overboard] Ah, ha-ha-ha...!
[unidentified crewman] Cold blooded - !
DAVY JONES: Life is cruel. Why should the afterlife be any *different*? I offer you a choice. Join my crew, and postpone the judgment. One hundred years before the mast. Will ye serve?
HELMSMAN: I - I will, serve.
DAVY JONES: Grand.
[Jones looks pleased, then sees Will at the end of the line of people]
[Jones stomps over to Will]
DAVY JONES: *You* are neither dead nor dying. What is your purpose here?
WILL TURNER: Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
DAVY JONES: What is your purpose here?
WILL TURNER: Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his debt.
DAVY JONES: Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.
[through a spyglass, Jack sees Jones turn to look directly at him] Black Pearl
[suddenly Jones is standing aboard the Black Pearl, directly in front of Jack and his spyglass]
[Cotton and Gibbs have knives to their throats from other Flying Dutchman crewmembers who teleported over]
JACK SPARROW: Oh.
DAVY JONES: You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. *That* was our agreement.
JACK SPARROW: Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.
DAVY JONES: Then you were a poor captain, but a *captain* nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as *Captain* Jack Sparrow?
JACK SPARROW: You have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.
DAVY JONES: One soul is not equal to another.
JACK SPARROW: Aha! So we've established my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price.
DAVY JONES: Price? Pttt!
JACK SPARROW: Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?
DAVY JONES: One hundred souls, three days-uh.
JACK SPARROW: You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off.
[Maccus blocks Jack from exiting]
DAVY JONES: I keep the boy. A good-faith payment. That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!
JACK SPARROW: Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him... would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?
DAVY JONES: I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam free?
JACK SPARROW: Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?
[Jones grabs Jack's hand, resulting in a squishy sound]
JACK SPARROW: Uh!
DAVY JONES: Three days. Three days.
[Pintel whimpers, with a knife held to his neck from a crewmember of Jones' ship]
[Jack looks at his hand, it's covered with slime, but the black spot disappears under the effect of the slime]
JACK SPARROW: Oh, Mr. Gibbs.
GIBBS: Aye.
JACK SPARROW: Uh, I feel sullied and unusual.
GIBBS: And how do you intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days?
JACK SPARROW: Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.
GIBBS: Ah... Tortuga!
JACK SPARROW: Tortuga.
Scene: Edinburgh Trader
[inside a cabin aboard the Edinburgh Trader, Captain Bellamy is throwing documents down on the table]
BELLAMY: It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then?
QUARTERMASTER: I'm afraid, Sir... Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters.
BELLAMY: A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep well each night, thank you.
[a white dress floats by the cabin window, outside]
BURSAR: S-S-Sir!
[they all rush to the window of the cabin and look out]
[they all see the dress float by the cabin window, on its second pass]
[one crewman gasps]
[the men go outside to see the dress that was floating by the window]
[the dress floats like a ghost, its left arm raised as if pointing]
BURSAR: She wants you to... do something.
BELLAMY: She's tryna give a sign.
[the dress sweeps over a lantern, knocking it over and part of the deck ignites]
BELLAMY: Over there! Look for a sign!
[the crew rush to the railing and look out at the sea]
[Elizabeth, up on the mast overhead, sighs in exasperation]
QUARTERMASTER: Look there! There it is. There's the sign.
BURSAR: That's seaweed.
QUARTERMASTER: S-Seaweed can be a sign.
BURSAR: Looks like entrails.  That would be a bad sign.
ELIZABETH SWANN: What's that over there?
[Elizabeth is now sitting on a platform on the deck behind the men, pointing at the deck where the lantern fell]
[the men at the railing turn around and look where Elizabeth is pointing]
[the fire burning on the desk spells out "Tortuga" in fiery letters] Tortuga
[men are tied up with ropes alongside a well, camera pans past the well]
[a man is tied up and being dunked in the well, and is spouting water from his mouth]
[crowded tavern, glass bottles are being shot off of people's heads for entertainment]
[a duo of musicians is playing a guitar and accordion]
GIBBS: And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?
ELDERLY MAN: Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young.
GIBBS: You'll do. Make your mark. Next!
JILTED MAN: My wife ran off with my dog. And I'm drunk for a month. And I don't give a ass rat's if I live or die.
GIBBS: Perfect! Next!
ONE-ARMED MAN: Me have one arm, 'n' a bum leg.
GIBBS: It's the crow's nest for you.
[Jack is sitting alongside a wall, within earshot of Gibbs' table, trying to make his Compass work]
JACK SPARROW: I know what I want.
GIBBS: Next!
ROMANTIC MAN: Ever since I was a little lad, I've always wanted to sail the seas. Forever.
GIBBS: Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.
ROMANTIC MAN: Thanks very much.
JACK SPARROW: How we going?
GIBBS: Including those four? That gives us - four!
[to the next candidate in line]
GIBBS: And what's *your* story?
NORRINGTON: My story... it's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the Seven Seas. The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life.
GIBBS: Commodore?
NORRINGTON: No, not anymore, weren't you *listening*? I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I would have, if not for the... hurricane.
GIBBS: Lord. You didn't try to sail through it?
NORRINGTON: So do I make your crew, or not? You haven't said where you're going. Somewhere *nice*!
[unidentified woman] Oh!
[the music stops, everyone stares at the altercation]
[Jack grabs a branch from a vase, carries it in front of his face, attempts to walk out unseen]
NORRINGTON: So am I *worthy* to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?
[Norrington spots Jack sneaking off behind him, points a pistol at Jack]
NORRINGTON: Or should I just kill you now?
[Jack ducks back and forth behind both sides of a large post, as Norrington points his pistol at Jack]
JACK SPARROW: You're hired.
NORRINGTON: Sorry. Old habits and all that.
[unidentifed man, to Norrington] Easy, sonny!
[someone deflects Norrington's pistol upwards as it fires]
[the ball richochets off the chandelier, breaking a man's bottle as he's drinking from it]
[the man whose bottle broke slugs a man next to him]
[the music starts back up as a brawl ensues]
[one man swings from chandelier, women fight, bottles are thrown against the wall, etc.]
JACK SPARROW: Time to go?
GIBBS: Aye!
[a swordfight is going on]
[someone throws a bottle against the wall above the stairs, Jack ducks as it smashes above his head]
[Jack makes his way upstairs, trading hats a few times along the way]
JACK SPARROW: Thanks, mate.
[Jack slaps him on the shoulder, the man falls backwards off the balcony]
[Jack halts to let two men carrying another man proceed towards the edge of the balcony]
JACK SPARROW: Carry on. Heave!
[the two men throw the carried man off the balcony, then Jack continues on his way]
[the music stops, Norrington threateningly holds a bottle in his left hand]
NORRINGTON: Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. Come on, who's first?
[from behind, Elizabeth grabs the bottle from Norrington, smashes it over his head, knocking him out]
ELIZABETH SWANN: I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself!
[the crowd cheers, and everyone holds up their mugs in a toast]
[men throw Norrington into the mud with some pigs, the crowd leaves except for Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth turns Norrington over, onto his back]
ELIZABETH SWANN: James Norrington. What has the world done to you?
[Mercer observes Elizabeth and Norrington from the doorway of the tavern] Flying Dutchman
[Jones plays his pipe organ with his tentacles, steam coming from pipes]
[the crew are on desk, slaving away, pulling rhythmically on a rope] Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave!
BO'SUN: Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner!
BO'SUN: Step to-it/tight!
[Will goes to grab a rope]
WILL TURNER: Step aside!
BO'SUN: Regain-yourselves!/Mind-yourself!
Scene: ###
[Bootstrap sees that the other man at the rope is his son, Bootstrap is stunned]
[Bootstrap lets go of the rope, Will attempts to grab the sliding rope]
[the cannon's rope drags Will across the deck]
[the hoisted cannon crashes to the deck, and the organ music stops]
BO'SUN: Haul that weevil to his feet!
[the crew haul Will to his feet]
BO'SUN: Five lashes to remind you... to stay on 'em!
BO'SUN: Impeding me in my duties. You'll share the punishment.
DAVY JONES: Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity?
DAVY JONES: Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous circumstance be this! Five lashes be owed. I believe it is.
[Jones hands the whip to Bootstrap, Jones' tentacle curls around the shaft of it]
DAVY JONES: The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own.
DAVY JONES: Bo'sun!
[Bootstrap reluctantly takes the whip]
[two crewmen tear Will's shirt off, exposing his bare back]
[Bootstrap whips Will's back five times]
[Will is tossed into a lower part of the deck, partially filled with water]
[Will stands up, wearing an intact white shirt]
BO'SUN: You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha!
WILL TURNER: I don't need your help!
WILL TURNER: So I'm to understand what *you* did was an act of compassion?
FLYING DUTCHMAN: below deck
[Bootstrap and Will enter the interior of the ship together]
[crewmember Wyvern is seen to their right, encrusted into the interior side of the hull, standing up]
WILL TURNER: I've sworn no oath.
WILL TURNER: Not until I find this. The key.
[Wyvern's eyes open in the coral-encrusted wall at the mention of the key]
[Wyvern, who is part of the wall, breaks his head away from the wall, leaving his brains behind]
WYVERN: The deadman's chest.
WILL TURNER: What do you know of this?
WYVERN: Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart, or there'll be no captain. And if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key.
WILL TURNER: So the captain has the key.
[Wyvern retracts his head back into the wall, having said too much]
WILL TURNER: Where *is* the key?
WYVERN: Hidden.
WILL TURNER: Where is the chest?
WYVERN: Hidden.
[Wyvern closes his eyes, and falls silent]
Scene: Black Pearl
[the Black Pearl is at a dock, loading fruits and livestock]
[Jack and Gibbs are walking together, Elizabeth approaches from behind, still dressed as a man]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Captain Sparrow!
JACK SPARROW: Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I'm here to find the man I love.
JACK SPARROW: I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.
[Norrington vomits over the side]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.
JACK SPARROW: Elizabeth. Hide the rum.
[Gibbs takes the bottle that Jack hands to him, and walks up the boarding plank in the background]
JACK SPARROW: You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack. I know Will came to find you. Where is he?
JACK SPARROW: Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Davy Jones?
[Norrington vomits over the side, then spits]
NORRINGTON: Oh, please. The captain of the Flying Dutchman.
JACK SPARROW: You look bloody awful. What are you doing here?
NORRINGTON: You *hired* me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.
JACK SPARROW: You *smell* funny.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack. All I want is to find Will.
JACK SPARROW: Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?
ELIZABETH SWANN: 'Course.
JACK SPARROW: Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most.
ELIZABETH SWANN: And you have a way of doing that?
JACK SPARROW: Well, there is a chest...
NORRINGTON: Oh, dear.
JACK SPARROW: A chest of unknown size and origin.
[Pintel & Ragetti walk by, together carrying a crate of bottles, and overhearing the conversation]
PINTEL: What contains the still-beating heart o' Davy Jones.
RAGETTI: Unh-unh... unh-unh... unh-unh...
JACK SPARROW: And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate.
NORRINGTON: You don't actually believe him, do you?
ELIZABETH SWANN: How do we find it?
JACK SPARROW: With this. My Compass... is unique.
NORRINGTON: "Unique" here having the meaning of broken.
JACK SPARROW: True enough. This Compass does not point north.
[Norrington vomits over the side]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Where does it point?
JACK SPARROW: It points to the thing you want most in this world.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth?
JACK SPARROW: Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?
ELIZABETH SWANN: To save Will?
JACK SPARROW: By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
[Jack hands the compass to Elizabeth, then draws away quickly so as not to influence the compass]
[Elizabeth consults the compass, for her the dial clearly points in a specific direction]
[Jack slowly rises up to peer at the face of the compass]
JACK SPARROW: Mister Gibbs!
GIBBS: Cap'n.
JACK SPARROW: We have our heading.
GIBBS: Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh anchor, and prow that canvas!
JACK SPARROW: Miss Swann.
Scene: GIBBS###
PINTEL: Welcome to the crew, former Commodore! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh...
[the goat neighs]
PORT ROYAL: EITC headquarters
[Beckett and Mercer are in a room with the governor, whose hands are in shackles]
[Mercer is looking through a mounted telescope to outside the window]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: There's something to knowing the exact shape of the world and one's place in it, don't you agree?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: I had you brought here because I thought you'd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter.
MERCER: Most recently seen on the island of Tortuga, then left, in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow. *And* other fugitives from justice.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Including the previous owner of this sword... I believe. Our ships are in pursuit. and justice will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass, and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal. I personally find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Shall I remove these shackles?
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: So you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept. Even for what he hopes never to sell.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
[slow motion scene of falling dice]
[three crewman are playing Liar's Dice]
[organ music is heard in the background]
MACCUS: I wager... ten years.
KOLENIKO: I'll match ten years.
GREENBEARD: Agreed.
WILL TURNER: I understand. Liar!
WILL TURNER: It's a game of deception. Your bet includes all the dice, not just your own.
WILL TURNER: What are they wagering?
WILL TURNER: So any crewman can be challenged?
WILL TURNER: I challenge Davy Jones.
[immediately the organ music ceases, immediately Jones' peg leg is heard thumping in approach]
[with each thump of his footstep, gooseneck barnacles retract]
[someone laughs]
DAVY JONES: I accept that-uh.
[Jones sits down at the gambling table]
DAVY JONES: The stakes?
WILL TURNER: My soul. An eternity of servitude.
DAVY JONES: Against?
WILL TURNER: I want this.
[Jack shows Jones the picture of the key]
DAVY JONES: How do you know of the key?
WILL TURNER: That's not part of the game, is it? You can still walk away.
[One of Jones' tentacles pulls out the key from his vest to display it]
[the tentacle puts the key back]
[Bootstrap sits down at the table]
DAVY JONES: What's this?
WILL TURNER: No! Don't do this.
DAVY JONES: Four fours.
WILL TURNER: Four fives.
DAVY JONES: Seven fives-uh.
WILL TURNER: Eight fives.
DAVY JONES: Huh huh huh. Welcome to the crew, liar.
DAVY JONES: And be called a liar myself for my trouble? Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship! Master Turner, feel free to go ashore... the very next time we make port!
WILL TURNER: Fool. Why did you do that?
WILL TURNER: It was never about winning, or losing.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: organ room
[nighttime on deck of the Flying Dutchman]
[Will emerges from a hatch on deck]
[Will sneaks past one one the crew on deck, who is sleeping with a bottle in his hand]
[Jones is asleep at his organ, snoring]
[Will sneaks into his room, behind him]
[Will grabs a nearby quill pen, uses it to lift one of Jones' tentacles]
[one tentacle accidentally falls on an organ key, almost waking up Jones]
[the falling tentacle also sets off a locket on top of the organ, that plays a song]
[Will holds one of the staves in his mouth while lifting the tentacles]
[Will finally removes the key, replaces it with his drawing of the key]
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
WILL TURNER: It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either.
WILL TURNER: They'll know you helped me.
WILL TURNER: I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise.
[Will sets out alone on a longboat]
Scene: Black Pearl
[crewmen are scrubbing the deck of the Black Pearl]
GIBBS: Beckett!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.
JACK SPARROW: Agh.
GIBBS: Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word.
JACK SPARROW: Agh.
GIBBS: Beckett wants the Compass. Only one reason for that.
JACK SPARROW: Of course. He wants the chest.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes, he did say something about a chest.
GIBBS: If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea.
JACK SPARROW: A truly discomforting notion, love.
GIBBS: And bad. Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate. I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails. Brace the foreyard!
JACK SPARROW: Might I inquire how as to how you came by these?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Persuasion.
JACK SPARROW: Friendly?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Decidedly not.
JACK SPARROW: Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price.
[Jack tucks the Letters into his coat and begins to walk away]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack, the Letters, give them back.
JACK SPARROW: No. Persuade me.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You do know Will taught me how handle a sword.
JACK SPARROW: As I said... Persuade me.
[Elizabeth walks away frustrated, leans on the ship's railing]
[Jack makes an odd grunting noise]
[Norrington walks up to Elizabeth at the railing]
NORRINGTON: It's a curious thing. There was a time when I would've given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I don't know what you mean.
NORRINGTON: Oh, I think you do.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's all.
NORRINGTON: So you never wondered how your *latest* fianc� ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place? Edinburgh Trader
BELLAMY: Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open waters.
WILL TURNER: Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can.
BELLAMY: And what are we running from?
[Will sees Elizabeth's white wedding dress on a chair in the cabin]
WILL TURNER: That dress. Where did you get it?
BELLAMY: It was found aboard the ship. The crew it thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate.
WILL TURNER: That's foolish.
QUARTERMASTER: Oh, yes. Proceededly foolish.
BURSAR: It brought good fortune! The spirit told us... Put in at Tortuga. And we made a nice bit of profit there.
BELLAMY: Off the books, of course.
WILL TURNER: I imagine... some of your crew may have jumped ship there.
BELLAMY: Why do you ask?
MESSENGER SAILOR: Captain, a ship's been spotted.
BELLAMY: Colors?
MESSENGER SAILOR: She isn't flyin' any.
BELLAMY: Pirates!
WILL TURNER: Or worse.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
[Jones is on deck, having found the cloth that Will swapped for the key]
[Bootstrap is held at knife point on board the Flying Dutchman]
[one crewman holds a sawfish sword as a restraining weapon in front of Bootstrap]
DAVY JONES: You will watch this.
[crewmen are whipped, in order to turn a large screw that raises the Kraken summoning device]
DAVY JONES: Let no joyful voice be heard! Let no man look up at the sky with hope! And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake... the *Kraken*!
[the Kraken calling device thumps heavily against the sea]
Scene: Edinburgh Trader
[crewmen on board the Edinburgh Trader rush to the railing, chattering, to see the Flying Dutchman]
[Will is on top of the mast]
WILL TURNER: I've doomed us all. It's the Flying Dutchman!
[a loud thumping sound resonates throughout the ship]
BURSAR: Oh, Mother Cary's chickens. What happened?
QUARTERMASTER: Must've hit a reef.
[the crew look overboard, see bubbles rising up alongside the ship]
BELLAMY: Free the rudder! Hard to port, then hard to starboard! Clear the rudder! Hard to port!
[a Kraken tentacle silently seizes one crewman while other crewmembers have their backs turned]
[the Kraken tentacle surfaces in the distance, holding the crewman who was just seized, he screams] *Kraken!*
[crewman rings the ship's bell wildly]
Scene: ###
[music stops, slow motion scene, a huge tentacle rises high over the ship]
[the tentacle comes down on deck, breaking the ship in two, bouncing men off the deck]
[slow motion scene, men slide off of tilted deck]
[Will is flung underwater, sees the body of the Kraken in the distance underwater]
[Will surfaces, climbs aboard a floating board of ship debris]
[the Flying Dutchman comes near Will, Will slides off his board to swim towards the ship]
[view from the bow of the Flying Dutchman, looking at the floating debris, including a face-down corpse]
[Elizabeth's wedding dress is also debris, and floats on the surface of the sea]
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
MACCUS: The boy's not here. He must've been claimed by the sea.
DAVY JONES: *I* am the sea.
[Jones stomps over to Bootstrap]
DAVY JONES: You need time alone with your thoughts. What of the survivors?
DAVY JONES: There are no survivors.
[the remaining crewmen are simultanenously axed from behind]
[Will witnesses the axing, ducks behind a beam]
[Jones turns around, sensing Will, but sees nothing]
DAVY JONES: The chest is no longer safe. Chart a course to Isla Cruces. Get me there first, or there'll be the devil to pay.
KOLENIKO: First?
DAVY JONES: Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship? Who told them of the key? Jack Sparrow.
[camera shows Will hitching a ride on the front of the Flying Dutchman, between the jaw formations]
[Elizabeth's wedding dress is shown underwater, sinking into the depths of the sea] Black Pearl
[Elizabeth is sitting on some steps on deck of the Black Pearl]
[Jack walks over to her, holding a bottle of rum]
JACK SPARROW: My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I just thought I'd be married by now. I'm so ready to be married.
[Jack offers Elizabeth a drink from his bottle]
JACK SPARROW: You know... Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*!
[Elizabeth recoils at Jack's breath on the word "now"]
ELIZABETH SWANN: No, thank you.
JACK SPARROW: Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh. Except for a sense of honor, and decency and-and a moral center. And personal hygiene.
[Jack smells his armpits]
JACK SPARROW: Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You seem very certain.
JACK SPARROW: One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Why doesn't your Compass work?
JACK SPARROW: Uh my Compass works fine.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Because you and I *are* alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the right thing.
JACK SPARROW: I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You'll have the chance to do something... something courageous. And when you do, you'll discover something: that you're a good man.
JACK SPARROW: All evidence to the contrary.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have faith in you. Want to know why?
JACK SPARROW: Do tell, dearie.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Curiosity. You're going to want it. A chance to be admired. And gain the rewards that follow. You won't be able to resist. You're going to want to know... what it tastes like.
JACK SPARROW: I *do* want to know what it tastes like.
ELIZABETH SWANN: But - seeing as you're a good man I know you will *never* put me in a position that would compromise my honor.
[Jack stares in horror as the black spot boils back into view on his hand, Elizabeth doesn't notice]
ELIZABETH SWANN: I'm proud of you, Jack.
GIBBS: Land ho!
JACK SPARROW: I want my jar of dirt.
Scene: Longboat
[Pintel and Ragetti are rowing a longboat with key members of the crew inside]
[Jack in the bow, Elizabeth and Norrington are in the back]
PINTEL: You're pullin' too fast.
RAGETTI: You're pulling too slow. We don't want the Kraken to catch us.
PINTEL: I'm savin' me strength for when it comes. And I don't think it's Krack-en, anyways. I always heard it said Kray-kin.
RAGETTI: What, with a long A?
PINTEL: Aye.
RAGETTI: No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Krock-en's how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and Krack-en's closer to that.
PINTEL: Well we ain't original Scandinavians, are we? Kray-ken!
RAGETTI: It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants.
ISLA CRUCES: beach
[their longboat arrives at the beach, Jack disembarks and begins to walk off]
JACK SPARROW: Guard the boat, mind the tide... Don't touch my dirt.
[Elizabeth is walking in some sand dunes near the beach, using the compass]
ELIZABETH SWANN: This doesn't work. And it *certainly* doesn't show you what you want most.
[Elizabeth sits down on the sand, and sets the compass down on the sand, the needle points to her]
JACK SPARROW: Yes it *does*. You're sitting on it!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Beg your pardon?
JACK SPARROW: Move.
[they start digging under where Elizabeth was sitting]
[Pintel and Ragetti are by the boat, clowning around, Ragetti is balancing a shovel on one hand]
PINTEL: "Mind the tide."
RAGETTI: I can/may join the circus!
PINTEL: Don't mind if I shine your shoes, Sir?
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
[Jones is watching Pintel and Ragetti on the beach through a spyglass]
DAVY JONES: They're here. And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade.
MACCUS: Then trust us to act in your stead.
DAVY JONES: I'll trust you know what awaits should you *fail*! Down, then!
[ugly, nondescript crewmember] Down!
MACCUS: Down!
[view from the deck of the Flying Dutchman as it submerges, some underwater footage]
[Pintel and Ragetti are astounded to see the ship submerge in the distance, Ragetti's balanced shovel falls]
[Pintel and Ragetti run off to warn the others]
Scene: ###!
ISLA CRUCES: beach
[Norrington is digging in the sand, Jack sits in a lotus position nearby on a sandy slope]
[while digging, Norrington's shovel hits something hard, they brush off sand to reveal a chest]
[they remove the chest from the sand]
[the chest contains a pearl necklace, documents, and a smaller chest, among other things]
[Elizabeth opens up a letter with a wax seal, and reads it to herself]
[they all bend near to put their ears to the small chest, and they hear a heartbeat]
ELIZABETH SWANN: It's real!
NORRINGTON: You actually *were* telling the truth.
JACK SPARROW: I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.
WILL TURNER: With good reason!
[Will has unexpectedly appeared on the beach, walking up toward them]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came to find you!
[Will and Elizabeth kiss]
JACK SPARROW: How did you get here?
WILL TURNER: Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped to my feet.
JACK SPARROW: Not so easy, is it?
WILL TURNER: But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
JACK SPARROW: You do?
WILL TURNER: After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones.
ELIZABETH SWANN: What?
JACK SPARROW: What?
WILL TURNER: I was reunited with my father.
JACK SPARROW: Oh! Well... you're welcome, then.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Everything you said to me... every word, was a lie!
JACK SPARROW: Pretty much. Time and tide, love.
[Will stoops down with the key to open the chest]
JACK SPARROW: Oy! What're you doing?
WILL TURNER: I'm gonna kill Jones.
[Jack draws his sword, points it at Will]
JACK SPARROW: Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key.
[Will backs up slowly, then suddenly draws Elizabeth's sword, points it at Jack]
WILL TURNER: I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.
[Norrington draws his sword, points it at Will]
NORRINGTON: I can't let you do that, either. So sorry.
JACK SPARROW: I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
[Norrington points his sword at Jack]
NORRINGTON: Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, and get my life back.
JACK SPARROW: Ah. The dark side of ambition.
NORRINGTON: Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Stop it! Be careful!
[various dueling interjections]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack!
WILL TURNER: Guard the chest!
[duel halts for a second]
ELIZABETH SWANN: *No*!
[duel resumes]
ELIZABETH SWANN: This is bar-*baric*! This is *no* way for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! Let's just - *pull* out our swords and start *banging* away at each other! *This will solve everything!* I've had it! I've had enough! Wobbly-legged, rum-soaked... *pirates*!
[Elizabeth throws a rock at the duelists, but the rock goes far to the left of them]
PINTEL: How'd this go all screwy? Enough!
RAGETTI: Well, each wants the chest for hisself, don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there - I figure 'e's tryna... settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father.
PINTEL: Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n a shiny penny.
RAGETTI: Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.
PINTEL: If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd remove temptation from their path.
[Pintel and Ragetti giggle and run off to steal the small chest]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will! *Enough!*
[Elizabeth is panting from exasperation and exhaustion]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh! Oh...! The heat!
[Elizabeth pretends to faint, which knocks off her hat]
[Elizabeth watches sideways as the duelists continue fighting, oblivious to her]
[Elizabeth soon sits up, puts on her hat]
[Pintel & Ragetti run by in the distance behind her, with the chest]
[Elizabeth sees Pintel & Ragetti, and goes to chase them]
[various duel scenes on the beach]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Bugger!
[Norrington kicks sand in Will's face]
NORRINGTON: By your leave, Mister Turner.
[Norrington runs off to chase Jack up the hill]
[the crew of Flying Dutchman emerge from the shallows]
[one crewmember holds chain shot as a weapon]
ISLA CRUCES: church
[Jack and Norrington run through bushes on the beach, then up to a dilapidated stone church on the hill] [P2]
[Norrington chases Jack up steps inside the building, Jack kicks Norrington back down with his foot]
[Jack and Norrington have a swordfight on the inside steps]
[Jack grabs hold of the bell rope, which carries him downward, and carries Will upward, who just arrived]
WILL TURNER: By *your* leave, Mister Norrington.
[the Flying Dutchman crew on shore are at the large chest and look up to the ringing bell in the building on the hill]
[while Norrington and Will are dueling on top of the roof, Jack deftly grabs the dangling key away from Norrington's hand]
[noticing the key gone, Norrington then turns and duels with Jack]
[soon Norrington knocks Jack's sword from Jack's hand, the sword is flung onto the ground below]
NORRINGTON: Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
WILL TURNER: Be my guest.
JACK SPARROW: Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
NORRINGTON: Enough!
[Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to Will]
NORRINGTON: Unfortunately, Mister Turner... He's *right*!
[Norrington and Will resume their part of the rooftop duel]
JACK SPARROW: Still rooting for you, mate!
[Jack picks up his sword from the ground, and puts the key around his neck]
[Jack walks through a graveyard, falls into an open grave]
JACK SPARROW: Wup!
[Jack stands up in the bottom of the hole]
JACK SPARROW: Oh.
[Norrington backs Will onto the top of the mill's waterwheel]
[the axle of the wheel breaks off with Norrington and Jack dueling on top]
[Jack is facing the other direction, so is unaware of the freed wheel rolling behind him]
[the wheel crashes through a small fence, turns, and rolls directly towards Jack]
[the waterwheel rolls over Jack, and Jack is pulled into the inside of the wheel]
JACK SPARROW: Woah!
[the key that Jack had around his neck falls off into the wheel]
[Jack struggles to grab the key, which is caught and dangling inside the rolling wheel]
[Jack finally grabs the key, but hits his head on a metal bar inside the wheel, and falls off the wheel]
[Pintel & Ragetti are running off with the small chest, each holding one side, giggling]
[Elizabeth steps in front Pintel & Ragetti, confronting them, halts, panting]
[Pintel & Ragetti drop the chest, pull their swords on Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth reaches for her sword, but it's gone]
PINTEL: 'Ello, Poppet.
[Pintel & Ragetti slowly advance on Elizabeth, she slowly retreats while facing them]
[they all pause for a moment to watch the wheel roll by with the duel on top]
[Jack is running behind the wheel, trying to catch up and get the key that is still inside]
[Pintel shrugs, Pintel and Ragetti resume advancing on Elizabeth]
[suddenly a thrown axe embeds itself in a coconut palm next to Elizabeth]
[all three turn to see Jones' crew crashing through the bushes toward them]
[swordfight ensues with the Flying Dutchmen crew and Pintel and Ragetti]
[Norrington and Will continue fighting atop the rolling wheel]
[Jack grabs hold of a palm frond on a coconut palm while at the top of the wheel]

[a sword is thrown to Elizabeth, just in time]
PINTEL: Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Pintel, just in time]
RAGETTI: Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Ragetti, just in time]
[Jack sees Hadrus running alone through the palms, carrying the small chest]
[Jack picks up a coconut, whirls it a moment, then throws it at Hadrus]
[Hadrus' (conch shell) head is knocked off by the coconut]
[Hadrus' head lies on the ground, attempting to give orders to the rest of his body to find the head]
HADRUS: Aya! Uh seech! Aunido! Aunido! Follow my voice! Follow my voice! To the left, uh... No, to the right... Go to the left...
[Hadrus' headless body walks into a coconut palm]
HADRUS: No... That's a tree.
JACK SPARROW: Oh, shut it.
[Jack unlocks the small chest with the key, square security bolts suddenly protrude when opened]
[the heart is inside, beating]
[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman approach, Jack tucks the heart into his vest]
[Elizabeth uses two swords together, one in each hand, to stab backwards and kill two attacking crewmen]
ISLA CRUCES: beach
[Jack is the first to arrive back at the longboat on the beach]
JACK SPARROW: Jar of dirt!
[Jack opens his jar of dirt, dumps out some dirt, puts the heart in the jar, scoops handfuls of dirt back into the jar]
[a Flying Dutchman crewmember arrives at the boat, Jack fights him using an oar]
[the swordfight is carried to the beach as the Black Pearl crew attempts to escape by longboat]
[Norrington arrives at the longboat, while others are fighting he takes the heart from the jar, puts it under his vest]
[the rolling waterwheel reaches the beach, rolls out into the shallows, falls on its side]
[Norrington and Will walk away from it, wobbling from dizziness]
WILL TURNER: Right!
[Pintel & Ragetti attempt to escape by longboat, but Will blocks their progress]
[Pintel & Ragetti reach for their swords, to find their swords gone]
[Pintel & Ragetti grab a fishnet and oar as weapons against Will]
PINTEL: Come on, Turner!
[Jack fights with Koleniko, using an oar, subdues him]
[Will sees the key in the chest, Jack notices Will looking at the key and chest]
[Jack hits Will on the head with the our, which knocks him out]
JACK SPARROW: Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.
ELIZABETH SWANN: We're not getting out of this.
NORRINGTON: Not with the chest. Into the boat.
[Norrington takes the chest]
ELIZABETH SWANN: You're mad.
NORRINGTON: Don't wait for me.
JACK SPARROW: Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
PINTEL: Aye!
[the remaining Black Pearl crew escape by longboat]
[Hadrus is holding his conch shell head under one arm, the head speaks to Norrington]
HADRUS: Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the chest away from your cold... dead... hands.
[Norrington pauses, looks around]
NORRINGTON: Here you go!
HADRUS: Oo!
[Norrington flees, Hadrus drops his head onto the ground when catching the chest]
[Hadrus' crewmates laugh and walk off with Hadrus' body, ignoring Hadrus' head]
HADRUS: Uh! Ando! Aunido! Aunido! Pirates!
[the face inside Hadrus' head turns around, turns into a hermit crab, extends its legs]
[the hermit crab head crawls after its departing body and crew]
HADRUS: Vengo kowmpenay lachay. Hey! Hovaya! Black Pearl
[Will, lying flat on the deck, head over a grate, returns to consciousness aboard the Black Pearl]
WILL TURNER: What happened to the chest?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Norrington took it to draw them off.
PINTEL: You're pulling too hard!
RAGETTI: You're not pulling hard enough!
GIBBS: Where's the Commodore?
JACK SPARROW: He fell behind.
GIBBS: My prayers be with him. Best not wallow in our grief. The bright side is: You're back. And made it off free and clear.
[the Flying Dutchman suddenly surfaces alongside them]
GIBBS: Lord almighty.us.
JACK SPARROW: I'll handle this, mate.
JACK SPARROW: Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey? Oup!
[Jack falls down the stairs of the Pearl, crew says "Ooh!"]
JACK SPARROW: Got it!
[Jack stands up, struts across the deck, holding his jar of dirt]
JACK SPARROW: Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git? Look what I got. I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it?
DAVY JONES: Enough!
[the Flying Dutchman's cannon covers slide down, cannons emerge from the holes]
JACK SPARROW: Hard to starboard.
ELIZABETH SWANN: *Hard to starboard!*
WILL TURNER: Brace up the foreyard!
GIBBS: Hard to starboard!
DAVY JONES: Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths! Fire!
[a heavy cannonade fires from the Flying Dutchman, blowing large holes in the Black Pearl]
[Pintel and Ragetti look through the gaping hole in the stern, see the Flying Dutchman following them]
PINTEL: She's on us! She's on us!
DAVY JONES: Let them taste the triple guns.
[cage-faced crewmember] Aye, Captain.
[triple-barreled cannon fires, barrel rotates after each blast]
DAVY JONES: Come on, ###!
ELIZABETH SWANN: She's falling behind!
GIBBS: Aye, and we've got her!
WILL TURNER: We're the faster?
GIBBS: Against the wind the Dutchman beats us. That's how she takes her prey. But *with* the wind...
WILL TURNER: We rob her advantage.
GIBBS: Ah!
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
DAVY JONES: They're out of range! Break out run ### We giving up, Sir?
[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman are whipped to raise the Kraken calling device]
Scene: BLACK PEARL
MARTY: They're giving up! Yay!
[crew cheers]
WILL TURNER: My father is *on* that ship. If we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight.
JACK SPARROW: Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs... is the proper leverage.
[suddenly the Black Pearl is badly jarred]
[Jack's jar of dirt falls to the deck, breaks open, spills all the dirt]
[Jack runs down to the spilled dirt, searches frantically for the heart, which is gone]
JACK SPARROW: Where is it? Where is the thump-thump? We must've hit the reef!
WILL TURNER: No. It's not a reef! Get away from the rail!
ELIZABETH SWANN: What is it?
WILL TURNER: The Kraken. To arms!
GIBBS: All guns, defend the masts!
WILL TURNER: It'll attack the starboard. I've seen it before. Break out the cannons and hold for my signal.
[with a deep rumbling sound, the Kraken's tentacles slowly crawl up the hull]
WILL TURNER: Easy, boys!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will?
[the tentacles rise higher]
WILL TURNER: Steady! Steady.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will?
[the tentacles start feeling around the ship]
WILL TURNER: Hold. Hold...
PINTEL: I think we've held fire long enough.
ELIZABETH SWANN: *Will?*
WILL TURNER: *Fire...*!
[the crew fire the cannons, hitting the tentacles and nearly severing some]
[the Kraken sinks into the sea, some tentacles glowing from the blast]
[the crew cheers]
WILL TURNER: It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
ELIZABETH SWANN: There's no boats.
[Will sees the wrecked boats, then sets his eyes on the barrels of gunpowder]
WILL TURNER: Pull the grates! Get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold.
[hands Elizabeth a long gun]
WILL TURNER: Whatever you do, don't miss.
ELIZABETH SWANN: As soon as you're clear.
[the crew is busy loading barrels of gunpowder from the hold] We are short stocked on gunpowder. Six barrel/below.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Bring it up!
GIBBS: There's only half a dozen kegs of powder!
WILL TURNER: Then load the rum!
[Gibbs seems shocked, then turns to see the entire crew halted, staring at him in shocked silence]
GIBBS: Aye! The rum, too!
[the crew continues loading]
[aerial view approaching Black Pearl, zooming through the rigging to the other side]
[Jack is in a rowboat alone, rowing away from the Black Pearl]
[Jack stops rowing, sees the Kraken with tentacles around Black Pearl in the distance]
[Jack looks back into the direction he's headed, then consults his Compass]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Step to!
[Elizabeth runs to the railing, sees Jack rowing away]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh you coward!
[another heavy thud hits the ship, crewmen shout]
MARTY: Not good.
[the Kraken attacks again]
WILL TURNER: Pull away!
GIBBS: Heave! Heave like you're being paid for it!
[Pintel & Ragetti stand to one side of a cannon port as a tentacle pulls one crewmember through sideways]
[Will hangs onto the side of the net of gunpowder barrels, attempting to attract the Kraken's attention]
WILL TURNER: Euh! Come on!I'm over here! Come on!
[Will slashes at tentacles with his sword]
WILL TURNER: Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!
[Elizabeth hesitates, waiting for Will to fall free]
[one of the Kraken's tentacles wrap around her leg and drag her backwards, she screams]
[Ragetti chops off the end of the tentacle holding Elizabeth]
[Another crewmember picks up the rifle and attempts to shoot, only to be grabbed by the Kraken and flung around]
[the rifle drops onto the deck above Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth tries to pick up the fallen rifle, but someone's foot holds it down]
[she sees that it's Jack's foot, that he has returned to the Pearl]
[Jack picks up the rifle and takes aim at the gunpowder]
[slow motion scene of Jack firing a ball into the gunpowder]
[ball whistles through the air, strikes the gunpowder, which explodes]
[the Kraken releases its hold, burned tentacles withdraw into the ocean, groaning sound]
MARTY: Did we kill it?
GIBBS: No. We just made it angry. We're not out of this yet. Captain! Orders!
JACK SPARROW: Abandon ship. Into the longboat.
GIBBS: Jack! The Pearl!
JACK SPARROW: She's only a ship, mate.
ELIZABETH SWANN: He's right, we have to head for land.
PINTEL: 'S a lot o' open wa'er.
RAGETTI: That's a lot o' wa'er.
WILL TURNER: We have to try. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl.
GIBBS: Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon hope.
[the crew get ready to leave the Pearl, loading supplies and guns]
[Elizabeth approaches Jack]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Thank you, Jack.
JACK SPARROW: We're not free yet, love.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You came back. I always knew you were a good man.
[Elizabeth passionately kisses Jack]
[Will sees the kiss from the longboat, falters]
GIBBS: Prepare to cast off! There's no time to lose! Come on, Will, step to!
[the kiss is inturrupted by the sound of shackles, Elizabeth has chained Jack to the main mast]
ELIZABETH SWANN: It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see? I'm not sorry.
[Elizabeth leans in as if to kiss him again.]
JACK SPARROW: Pirate.
[Elizabeth leaves Jack and climbs down into the long boat]
WILL TURNER: Where's Jack?
ELIZABETH SWANN: He elected to stay behind to give us a chance.
[the crew look uncertain]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Go!
[the longboat casts off]
[Jack struggles with his manacles]
JACK SPARROW: Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...!
[a coconut and cannonball roll by, on the tilted deck]
[Jack spots a fallen lantern, picks it up with the tip of his sword]
[Jack breaks the lantern against the mast, pours oil over his wrists]
[Jack struggles with slipping his hand out]
JACK SPARROW: Come on... Come on...
[Jack finally manages to slip his hands out]
[the Kraken rises up behind him]
[Jack halts, turns around, faces the Kraken]
[music and sound stop momentarily]
[the Kraken roars, spraying Jack with slime and flinging his earlier-eaten hat to the deck]
JACK SPARROW: Not so bad.
[Jack spots his old hat lying next to his feet]
JACK SPARROW: Oh!
[Jack spots his hat, picks it up, puts it on, wipes slime from his face]
JACK SPARROW: Hello, beastie.
[slow motion scene of Jack boldy charging toward the Kraken's mouth, sword drawn] [Q3]
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
DAVY JONES: Jack Sparrow. Our debt is settled.
KOLENIKO: The captain goes down with his ship.
MACCUS: Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the devil.
DAVY JONES: Open the chest. Open the chest, I need to see it!
[the chest is opened, side view as Jones looks in, his face quivers]
[downwards view, showing that the chest is empty, Jones tilts his head back and shouts]
DAVY JONES: Damn you, Jack Spar-*row*!
PORT ROYAL: EITC headquarters
MERCER: The last of our ships has returned.
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: Is there any news on the chest?
MERCER: None. But... one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea. He had these.
[Mercer drops the Letters of Marque on Beckett's desk]
[Beckett opens the letter to look at it before looking up at Norrington, who has been standing in the office]
NORRINGTON: I took the liberty of filling in my name.
[from his desk, Beckett beckons Norrington with two fingers]
LORD CUTLER BECKETT: If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade. D'you have the Compass?
NORRINGTON: Better. The heart of Davy Jones.
BAYOU: Tia's shack
[the remaining crew paddles through the waters to Tia Dalma's shack]
[many natives stand in the waters surrounding the shack, holding candles, mourning Jack Sparrow]
[inside the shack, Will absent-mindedly keeps throwing his father's knife into the table top]
[Tia carries a tray around to all of them, offers the mugs to Elizabeth]
TIA DALMA: Against de cold... and de sorrow.
[Elizabeth takes a mug but doesn't drink]
TIA DALMA: It's a shame. I know you're t'inking that wid the Pearl, you coulda captured the devil and set free your fadder's soul.
WILL TURNER: Doesn't matter now. The Pearl's gone. Along with its captain.
[Gibbs is standing in the doorway on the side of the shack]
GIBBS: Aye. And already the world seems a bit less bright. He fooled us all right to the end. But I guess that honest streak finally won out. To Jack Sparrow!
RAGETTI: Never another like Captain Jack.
PINTEL: He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.
ELIZABETH SWANN: He was a good man.
[they all take a drink out of their mugs, except Elizabeth]
WILL TURNER: If there was anything could be done to bring him back... Elizabeth...
TIA DALMA: Would you do it? Hmmm? What... would you? Hmmm? What would *any* of you be willing to do? Hmmm? Would you sail to the ends of the eart', and beyond, to fetch back witty Jack and 'im precious Pearl?
GIBBS: Aye.
PINTEL: Aye.
RAGETTI: Aye.
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk! Aye.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes.
WILL TURNER: Aye.
TIA DALMA: Alright. But if you're goin' brave de weird, and haunted shores, at world's end, den... you will need a captain who knows dose waters.
[a man wearing boots descends the stairs into the room]
BARBOSSA: So tell me, what's become of my ship?
[Barbossa bites into a green apple, juice dripples down his chin]
[Jack the monkey on Barbossa's left shoulder faces the camera and snarls]
